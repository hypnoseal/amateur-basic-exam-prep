question: "What should you do if you discover someone who is being burned by high voltage?"
answers:
  - text: "Turn off the power, call for emergency help and provide first aid if needed"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the safest and most comprehensive approach to handling a high-voltage electrical injury. By first ensuring power is disconnected, you prevent further electrical exposure to both the victim and yourself. Calling emergency services immediately ensures professional medical help, while providing first aid can help minimize shock and potential complications from electrical burns."
  - text: "Wait for a few minutes to see if the person can get away from the high voltage on their own, then try to help"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Delaying assistance in an electrical injury situation can be life-threatening. Electrical current can cause immediate cardiac arrest, muscle paralysis, and severe internal burns. Every second counts, and waiting could result in permanent injury or death. Immediate action is critical to prevent further harm."
  - text: "Immediately drag the person away from the high voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Attempting to physically move a person still in contact with high voltage is extremely dangerous. You could become an additional victim by completing the electrical circuit. Without first disconnecting the power, touching the victim can transmit fatal electrical current through your own body."
  - text: "Run from the area so you won't be burned too"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Abandoning someone in a high-voltage emergency is not only unethical but potentially criminal. As an amateur radio operator and responsible citizen, you have a moral and potentially legal obligation to help someone in immediate danger while protecting your own safety through proper procedures."

## The Concept: Electrical Injury Response Principles

Electrical injuries are unique and potentially fatal emergencies that require a specific, systematic approach. Unlike other types of burns, electrical injuries cause damage both externally and internally, with current potentially disrupting heart rhythm, causing muscle tetany (sustained contraction), and creating deep tissue damage that may not be immediately visible.

The fundamental principle of electrical emergency response is **safety first** - for both the victim and the rescuer. Electrical current follows the path of least resistance, which means a well-intentioned rescuer can quickly become a second victim if proper precautions aren't taken.

### The Physics of Electrical Injury

When high voltage contacts human tissue, several dangerous phenomena can occur:
- **Electrical Current Disruption**: Electricity can interfere with heart and nerve electrical signals
- **Thermal Damage**: Intense heat can cause deep, severe burns
- **Muscle Tetany**: Electrical current can cause muscles to contract violently, preventing self-rescue

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Emergency Response Scenarios:
- **Amateur Radio Field Day**: Discovering someone accidentally contacting high-voltage equipment
- **Emergency Communications Setup**: Encountering electrical hazards during antenna installation
- **Portable Operation**: Responding to electrical incidents in remote locations

### ❌ Dangerous Incorrect Approaches:
- **Panic Response**: Freezing or running away
- **Uninformed Rescue**: Touching victim without disconnecting power
- **Delayed Action**: Waiting to see what happens

## Practical Applications

### For Emergency Responders:
1. **Power Disconnection**: Immediately shut off electrical source using main breaker or disconnect switch
2. **Call for Help**: Contact emergency medical services immediately
3. **Personal Protection**: Use non-conductive materials if needed to separate victim from power source
4. **First Aid**: Provide CPR or other emergency care as trained

### Safety Equipment Recommendations:
1. **Rubber Insulating Gloves**: Protect against electrical transmission
2. **Non-Conductive Rescue Tools**: Wood or fiberglass poles to separate victim from electrical source
3. **Personal Emergency Kit**: Include insulating materials and basic first aid supplies

### Memory Aid:
"**P-A-C**": **P**ower off, **A**lert emergency services, **C**are for victim
