    explanation: "ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) does not impose any minimum or maximum age restrictions for obtaining an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate with Basic Qualification.

The focus is on demonstrating knowledge and understanding of radio communications principles, not on age."

    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. There are no upper age limits for amateur radio licensing in Canada. Amateur radio is an inclusive hobby that welcomes participants of all ages, and experience and enthusiasm are valued over age restrictions. Operators can continue enjoying amateur radio throughout their lifetime without any mandatory retirement age."
