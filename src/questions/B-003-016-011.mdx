question: "A lithium-ion battery should never be:"
answers:
  - text: "short-circuited"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Short-circuiting a lithium-ion battery creates an uncontrolled electrical path with extremely low resistance, causing massive current flow that can rapidly generate intense heat. This can lead to thermal runaway, where the battery's internal temperature increases exponentially, potentially causing the battery to violently rupture, catch fire, or explode. The battery's internal chemistry is designed with delicate electrochemical balance, and a short circuit can catastrophically disrupt this balance in milliseconds."
  - text: "recharged"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Recharging is actually a normal and expected function for lithium-ion batteries. Modern lithium-ion batteries are specifically designed to be recharged multiple times using appropriate charging equipment. Controlled recharging is fundamental to the battery's operational lifecycle and is how these batteries provide portable power in amateur radio and many other applications."
  - text: "left disconnected"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Leaving a lithium-ion battery disconnected is perfectly safe and in many cases recommended. When not in use, storing a lithium-ion battery in a cool, dry place at approximately 50% charge helps preserve its long-term health and prevents capacity degradation. Disconnected storage is a standard practice for maintaining battery longevity."
  - text: "left overnight at room temperature"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Room temperature storage is actually ideal for lithium-ion batteries. Most lithium-ion batteries perform best and maintain optimal health when stored between 20-25°C (68-77°F). Leaving the battery at room temperature overnight does not pose any risk and is a standard storage practice for maintaining battery performance and safety."

## The Concept: Lithium-Ion Battery Chemistry and Risk Management

Lithium-ion batteries represent a remarkable technological achievement, providing high energy density in a compact package. Unlike older battery technologies, they use a complex electrochemical system where lithium ions move between the positive and negative electrodes during charging and discharging.

The internal structure of a lithium-ion battery is precisely engineered with thin, closely packed layers of conductive materials. This design allows rapid ion transfer but also creates potential vulnerability if the internal electrical balance is disrupted. A short circuit represents the most dangerous potential disruption to this delicate system.

### The Short Circuit Danger

A short circuit occurs when electrical current finds an unintended, low-resistance path between the battery's positive and negative terminals. In lithium-ion batteries, this can trigger a catastrophic chain reaction called "thermal runaway" where internal temperature increases exponentially within seconds.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Safe Lithium-Ion Battery Practices:
- **Proper Terminal Protection**: Always use caps or covers on battery terminals
- **Careful Storage**: Keep batteries away from metal objects that could cause accidental shorting
- **Use Appropriate Chargers**: Only use chargers specifically designed for lithium-ion chemistry
- **Regular Inspection**: Check for physical damage or swelling before use

### ❌ Dangerous Lithium-Ion Battery Behaviors:
- **Dropping Battery with Exposed Terminals**: Risk of internal short circuit
- **Using Damaged Batteries**: Compromised internal structure increases failure risk
- **Exposing to Extreme Temperatures**: Can accelerate internal chemical breakdown
- **Puncturing or Crushing**: Can cause immediate internal short circuit
