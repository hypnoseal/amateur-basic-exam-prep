question: "You are transmitting using amplitude modulation. What bandwidth does your signal occupy if the highest frequency of your voice is 3 kHz?"
answers:
  - text: "6 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In amplitude modulation (AM), the signal bandwidth is twice the highest modulating frequency. When the highest audio frequency is 3 kHz, the total signal bandwidth is 6 kHz. This occurs because AM creates two symmetric sidebands around the carrier frequency, each extending to the maximum audio frequency. In this case, the signal will occupy frequencies from (carrier - 3 kHz) to (carrier + 3 kHz), resulting in a total bandwidth of 6 kHz."
  - text: "3 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because AM creates two complete sidebands, each extending to the maximum audio frequency. A 3 kHz signal would only represent one sideband, not the full AM signal's spectral characteristics."
  - text: "12 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this bandwidth is larger than necessary, it does not accurately represent the standard AM signal bandwidth for a 3 kHz audio signal. Doubling the bandwidth beyond twice the highest modulating frequency would unnecessarily occupy spectrum space."
  - text: "9 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This bandwidth is incorrect for a standard AM signal with a 3 kHz maximum audio frequency. The signal would extend symmetrically 3 kHz on each side of the carrier, creating a total 6 kHz bandwidth."

## The Concept: Amplitude Modulation and Spectral Characteristics

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a method of transmitting information by varying the amplitude of a carrier wave in proportion to the amplitude of the modulating signal (typically audio). Unlike other modulation modes, AM creates a symmetric spectrum around the carrier frequency, with each sideband extending to the maximum modulating frequency.

When you speak into an AM transmitter, your voice creates frequency components that "push" and "pull" the carrier wave's amplitude. Each audio frequency generates corresponding sidebands above and below the carrier frequency. The total bandwidth is directly related to the highest frequency in your audio signal.

### The Bandwidth Calculation

The fundamental rule for AM bandwidth is simple: **Total Bandwidth = 2 × Highest Modulating Frequency**

If your voice's highest frequency is 3 kHz, the signal will occupy:
- Lower sideband: Carrier frequency - 3 kHz
- Carrier frequency
- Upper sideband: Carrier frequency + 3 kHz

This creates a total occupied bandwidth of 6 kHz, symmetrically distributed around the carrier.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct AM Bandwidth Scenarios:
- **Voice Communication**: 3 kHz audio maximum → 6 kHz total bandwidth
- **Music Transmission**: 15 kHz audio range → 30 kHz total bandwidth
- **Narrow-Band AM**: Intentionally limiting audio to 2.4 kHz → 4.8 kHz bandwidth

### ❌ Bandwidth Misconceptions:
- **Single Sideband Thinking**: Incorrectly assuming only one sideband contributes to bandwidth
- **Ignoring Carrier**: Forgetting that the carrier frequency is part of the total occupied spectrum
- **Oversimplifying Frequency Relationships**: Not understanding the symmetric nature of AM sidebands

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Frequency Planning**: Understanding signal bandwidth helps avoid interference with nearby stations
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose modulation modes based on available bandwidth in different amateur radio bands
3. **Receiver Filtering**: Set receiver bandwidth to match the expected signal characteristics

### For Different Operating Conditions:
1. **Contesting**: Use narrow AM bandwidth to maximize spectral efficiency
2. **DX Communication**: Understand how bandwidth affects signal propagation and readability
3. **Emergency Communications**: Select modulation modes that maximize information transfer within limited bandwidth

### Memory Aid:
"**D**ouble the **F**requency = **B**andwidth" - In AM, doubling the highest modulating frequency doubles your signal's bandwidth.
