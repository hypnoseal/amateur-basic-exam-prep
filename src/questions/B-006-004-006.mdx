question: "Assuming the same transmitter and RF output power are used, what is the effect of changing the transmission line from RG-213 coaxial cable to RG-58?"
answers:
  - text: "Less RF power is radiated from the antenna"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Switching from RG-213 to RG-58 increases transmission line losses, which means less RF power reaches the antenna. RG-58 has a smaller conductor diameter and higher attenuation per meter compared to RG-213, resulting in more signal energy being converted to heat within the cable before reaching the antenna."
  - text: "More RF power is radiated from the antenna"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because RG-58 has higher transmission line losses compared to RG-213, which means less power will actually reach the antenna. The thinner, higher-loss cable will reduce the RF power transferred to the radiating element."
  - text: "SWR at the transmitter increases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Cable type change alone does not necessarily change the antenna's impedance or system SWR. The SWR depends on the antenna's characteristics and impedance match, not solely on the transmission line's physical properties."
  - text: "SWR at the transmitter decreases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Changing cable types does not inherently modify the antenna's impedance or system matching. The SWR remains primarily dependent on the antenna's design and installation characteristics."

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

## The Concept: Transmission Line Power Loss

Coaxial cables are critical components in amateur radio systems, serving as the crucial link between transmitters and antennas. Not all coaxial cables are created equal - their physical characteristics significantly impact signal transmission efficiency.

RG-213 and RG-58 represent two common coaxial cable types with notable differences in physical construction. The primary distinctions lie in their conductor diameter, dielectric material, and overall design, which directly influence their electrical characteristics and power transmission capabilities.

### Cable Loss Mechanisms

Transmission line losses occur through two primary mechanisms:
1. **Conductor Losses**: Energy dissipated as heat in the cable's metallic conductors
2. **Dielectric Losses**: Energy absorbed by the insulating material between conductors

RG-58, being a thinner cable with smaller conductors, experiences significantly higher losses compared to the more robust RG-213.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Comparative Cable Performance:
- **RG-213**: Larger diameter (10.3 mm), lower loss, better for longer runs and higher power
- **RG-58**: Smaller diameter (5 mm), higher loss, suitable for shorter, low-power applications
- **Typical Loss Comparison**: At 146 MHz, RG-58 might have 3-4 dB loss per 100 meters, while RG-213 might have only 1-2 dB loss for the same distance

### ❌ Inappropriate Cable Selection Scenarios:
- **HF Long-Distance Transmission**: Using RG-58 for runs over 20-30 meters can significantly reduce effective radiated power
- **High-Power Contesting**: Selecting RG-58 for high-power operations can lead to excessive signal attenuation
- **Critical Communication Links**: Choosing lower-quality cables in scenarios requiring maximum signal transfer

## Practical Applications

### For Antenna System Design:
1. **Cable Length Considerations**: Longer cable runs amplify loss differences between cable types
2. **Frequency-Dependent Losses**: Higher frequencies experience more significant loss variations
3. **Power Handling Capabilities**: RG-213 supports higher power levels with less signal degradation

### For Different Amateur Radio Bands:
1. **VHF/UHF**: Cable loss becomes more critical due to shorter wavelengths
2. **HF**: Losses are less pronounced but still significant for longer transmission lines
3. **Portable Operations**: Lighter RG-58 might be preferred for weight-sensitive deployments

### Memory Aid:
"**T**hick **C**ables **C**arry **C**learer Signals" - Thicker cables like RG-213 provide clearer signal transmission compared to thinner alternatives.
