question: "What should you do before you transmit on any frequency?"
answers:
  - text: "Listen to make sure others are not using the frequency"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Listening before transmitting is a fundamental principle of amateur radio etiquette and regulatory compliance. This practice, known as 'listening first' or 'checking the frequency', helps prevent interference with ongoing communications, respects other operators' use of the frequency, and demonstrates professional operating practices. It allows you to verify the frequency is available and understand any ongoing conversations or net operations."
  - text: "Check your antenna for resonance at the selected frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While antenna resonance is important for efficient transmission, it is not the first action you should take before transmitting. Checking antenna resonance is typically done during station setup or before a contest/expedition, but it doesn't replace the critical step of listening to ensure the frequency is not in use. Transmitting without first listening can cause harmful interference to active communications."
  - text: "Make sure the SWR on your transmission line is high enough"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is technically incorrect. High SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) is actually undesirable and can damage radio equipment. Low SWR indicates efficient power transfer and minimal signal reflection. Moreover, checking SWR is a technical setup consideration, not the primary action required before transmitting. The first and most important step is always to listen and verify the frequency is available."
  - text: "Increase power to ensure someone will hear you"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Increasing power without first listening is a violation of amateur radio operating principles. It wastes energy, potentially causes interference, and goes against the core amateur radio ethic of efficient, considerate communication. The goal is not to transmit with maximum power, but to communicate effectively while minimizing interference to other users of the shared radio spectrum."

# Frequency Courtesy: The Critical Importance of Listening Before Transmitting

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- Why listening before transmitting is fundamental to amateur radio operations
- The ethical and technical reasons for checking a frequency before use
- How to properly assess a frequency for availability
- The potential consequences of transmitting without proper frequency checking

## The Concept: The Listen-First Principle

Amateur radio operates on shared frequency bands where multiple operators and services coexist. Unlike commercial broadcast or cellular communications with dedicated channels, amateur radio frequencies are dynamic, collaborative spaces where operators must practice mutual respect and situational awareness.

The **listen-first principle** is more than just a courtesy—it's a critical operational skill that ensures efficient, interference-free communication. By listening before transmitting, you:
- Avoid interrupting ongoing conversations
- Prevent potential harmful interference
- Demonstrate professional operating standards
- Gather important contextual information about current band conditions

### The Shared Spectrum Ecosystem

Think of amateur radio frequencies like a large, shared conference room where multiple conversations can happen simultaneously. Before speaking, you'd naturally first listen to understand what's happening, who's already talking, and whether it's appropriate to join the discussion. Radio frequencies work exactly the same way.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Listening Procedures:
- **Before a Local Net**: Listen to understand the net's structure and current discussion before checking in
- **During Weak Signal Conditions**: Carefully monitor frequency to catch low-power or distant stations
- **International Bands**: Listen to understand potential language or operating mode differences

### ❌ Inappropriate Transmission Behaviors:
- **Blind Transmitting**: Sending a call without first checking the frequency
- **Continuous Calling**: Repeatedly calling without pausing to listen
- **Ignoring Ongoing Communications**: Interrupting established contacts or nets

## Practical Applications

### For New Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Use Your Receiver's Features**: Many modern transceivers have excellent filtering and noise reduction to help you hear weak signals
2. **Take Your Time**: Spend at least 30-60 seconds carefully monitoring before transmitting
3. **Learn to Detect Subtle Signals**: Practice distinguishing between noise, weak signals, and truly clear frequencies

### Listening Techniques:
1. **Carrier Sense**: Listen for any carrier signals indicating active use
2. **Background Noise Assessment**: Understand the difference between band noise and active signals
3. **Digital Mode Monitoring**: Learn to recognize digital mode activity which might not sound like traditional voice communications
