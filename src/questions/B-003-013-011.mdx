question: "When more than one signal is present, the FM receiver is likely to demodulate only the strongest signal. What is this behaviour called?"
answers:
  - text: "Capture effect"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In FM (Frequency Modulation) systems, the capture effect describes the phenomenon where a receiver will lock onto and demodulate only the strongest of multiple simultaneous signals on the same frequency. This occurs because FM demodulators are designed to track the instantaneous frequency of the most powerful signal, effectively 'capturing' and reproducing only that signal while suppressing weaker competing signals."
  - text: "Overpower effect"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is not a standard technical term in radio communications. While the description sounds similar to the capture effect, 'overpower effect' is not a recognized scientific or engineering term used to describe signal selection in FM receivers."
  - text: "Interference effect"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Interference effect is a broader term describing how different signals can disrupt each other's reception, but it doesn't specifically describe the selective demodulation behavior of FM receivers where only the strongest signal is processed."
  - text: "Surrender effect"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is not a real technical term in radio communications. It sounds similar to the capture effect but is not a scientifically recognized description of signal selection in FM receivers."

## The Concept: Signal Capture in Frequency Modulation

Frequency Modulation (FM) is a method of radio transmission where information is encoded by variations in the instantaneous frequency of a carrier wave. Unlike amplitude modulation (AM), FM is particularly susceptible to a unique phenomenon called the **capture effect**, where a receiver will preferentially demodulate the strongest signal present on a given frequency.

Imagine multiple people talking simultaneously in a noisy room. Your brain naturally focuses on the loudest voice, essentially "capturing" that conversation while filtering out the others. FM receivers work similarly - they have a built-in mechanism that allows them to lock onto and reproduce only the most powerful signal, effectively "hearing" just one transmission even when multiple signals are present.

### Technical Mechanism

The capture effect occurs because FM demodulators use phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits that rapidly track frequency changes. When multiple signals are present, the circuit will automatically synchronize with the signal that has the highest signal-to-noise ratio, effectively suppressing weaker competing signals.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Practical Capture Effect Scenarios:
- **Repeater Communications**: When two stations transmit simultaneously, the stronger signal will be heard
- **Mobile Communications**: Signals from closer transmitters will override more distant, weaker signals
- **Emergency Communications**: Critical communications with stronger signals will dominate shared frequencies

### ❌ Situations Where Capture Effect Can Be Problematic:
- **Weak Signal Modes**: Low-power or distant stations may be completely blocked by stronger signals
- **Crowded Frequency Bands**: Multiple simultaneous transmissions can lead to incomplete communication
- **Emergency Coordination**: Important but weaker signals might be unintentionally suppressed

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Signal Planning**: Understanding that stronger signals will dominate frequency use
2. **Repeater Operations**: Recognizing why only the strongest station is typically heard during simultaneous transmissions
3. **Emergency Communications**: Using higher power or better antenna positioning to ensure message delivery

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Threshold Effects**: Typically, a signal must be about 3-6 dB stronger to completely capture the receiver
2. **Frequency Proximity**: Signals very close in frequency are more likely to trigger the capture effect
3. **Modulation Characteristics**: FM's capture effect is more pronounced than in AM or SSB modes

### Memory Aid:
"**S**trongest **S**ignal **S**urvives" - In FM, the most powerful signal will be the one demodulated.
