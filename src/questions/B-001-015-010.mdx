question: "What is the frequency range of the 10-metre amateur radio band in Canada?"
answers:
  - text: "28.000 MHz to 29.700 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the precise 10-metre band allocation for Canadian amateur radio operators as defined by ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada). This 1.7 MHz wide segment represents a significant portion of the high-frequency (HF) spectrum, offering excellent long-distance communication possibilities during periods of good ionospheric propagation."
  - text: "24.890 MHz to 24.990 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range corresponds to the 12-metre amateur radio band, not the 10-metre band. While also an HF band, it is significantly lower in frequency and much narrower than the 10-metre band allocation."
  - text: "21.000 MHz to 21.450 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range represents the 15-metre amateur radio band. It is located at a lower frequency than the 10-metre band and has a different bandwidth and propagation characteristics."
  - text: "50.000 MHz to 54.000 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range is actually the 6-metre band, which is a VHF (Very High Frequency) band with very different propagation characteristics compared to the 10-metre HF band. This band is much higher in frequency and behaves quite differently from HF bands."

## The Concept: Understanding the 10-Metre Amateur Radio Band

The 10-metre band is a high-frequency (HF) amateur radio allocation that spans from 28.000 MHz to 29.700 MHz, representing a critical segment of the radio spectrum that offers unique communication possibilities. This relatively wide 1.7 MHz bandwidth provides amateur radio operators with significant flexibility for various modes of communication, including voice, digital, and morse code transmissions.

### Propagation Characteristics

10-metre band communications are particularly interesting because of their complex propagation characteristics. During periods of high solar activity, this band can support remarkable long-distance communications through ionospheric skip, allowing contacts thousands of kilometers away with relatively low transmitter power.

The band's position near the top of the HF spectrum means it transitions between traditional HF propagation and the beginning of VHF-like characteristics, making it a fascinating range for experimental and long-distance communications.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Typical 10-Metre Band Applications:
- **DX (Long Distance) Contacts**: Worldwide communications during solar maximum
- **Digital Mode Experiments**: FT8 and other weak-signal digital communications
- **Satellite Communications**: Some amateur satellites use portions of this band
- **Contests and Competitive Operating**: Popular band for international radio contests

### ❌ Limitations and Challenges:
- **Solar Cycle Dependency**: Performance varies dramatically with solar activity
- **Narrow Bandwidth**: Requires careful frequency management
- **Crowded Segments**: Popular modes can lead to significant QRM (interference)

## Practical Applications

### For HF Operators:
1. **Frequency Selection**: Understand the band's sub-segments for different modes
2. **Antenna Considerations**: Design antennas optimized for 10-metre performance
3. **Propagation Prediction**: Use solar indices to predict band openings

### Equipment Recommendations:
1. **Multi-Mode Radios**: Capable of SSB, CW, and digital modes
2. **Low-Power Transceivers**: Many effective 10-metre radios operate at 100W or less
3. **Simple Antennas**: Dipoles and verticals work well on this band
