question: "What is the total resistance of five 10-ohm resistors in series?"
answers:
  - text: "50 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a series circuit, resistances are added together. Each 10-ohm resistor contributes its full resistance to the total, so five 10-ohm resistors will result in a total resistance of 50 ohms. This follows the fundamental rule of series circuits: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5."
  - text: "5 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would be the result if the resistors were connected in parallel, not series. In a series circuit, resistances are added together, not divided, so the total resistance will be significantly higher than any individual resistor's value."
  - text: "10 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This matches the value of a single resistor, but fails to account for the additional resistors in the series circuit. When resistors are connected in series, each adds its full resistance to the total."
  - text: "2 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would represent a reduction in resistance, which is impossible in a series circuit. Series connections always increase total resistance, not decrease it."

## The Concept: Series Resistance Fundamentals

In electrical circuits, resistors connected in series are arranged end-to-end, with the same current flowing through each component. When resistors are connected in this configuration, their individual resistance values are simply added together to calculate the total circuit resistance.

The fundamental rule for series resistance is straightforward: **Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn**. Each resistor contributes its full resistance value to the total, creating a cumulative effect that increases the circuit's overall resistance.

### Why Resistances Add in Series

Imagine electrical current as water flowing through a series of narrow pipes. Each pipe (resistor) restricts the flow, and the total restriction increases with each additional pipe. Similarly, each resistor in a series circuit creates additional opposition to electrical current, increasing the total resistance.
