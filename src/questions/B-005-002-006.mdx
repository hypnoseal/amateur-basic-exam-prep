question: "What electrical property causes an object to conduct electricity very well?"
answers:
  - text: "Low resistance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Low resistance allows electric current to flow easily through a material with minimal opposition. The lower the resistance, the more readily electrons can move through the material, creating an efficient electrical conductor. Materials like copper, silver, and aluminum have low resistance, which makes them excellent conductors of electricity."
  - text: "Low reluctance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Reluctance is a concept from magnetic circuits, analogous to electrical resistance, but it relates to magnetic materials' ability to conduct magnetic flux, not electrical current. It's not directly related to electrical conductivity and cannot be used to describe an object's ability to conduct electricity."
  - text: "Low capacitance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Capacitance measures an object's ability to store electrical charge, not its ability to conduct electricity. While capacitance is an important electrical property, it does not determine how well a material allows electric current to flow through it."
  - text: "Low admittance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Admittance is the reciprocal of impedance and measures how easily alternating current flows through a component. While mathematically related to conductivity, it's not the direct property that describes an object's ability to conduct electricity in the way the question implies."

## The Concept: Electrical Resistance and Conductivity

Electrical resistance is a fundamental property of materials that describes how much they oppose the flow of electric current. Think of resistance like friction for electrons - the lower the resistance, the more easily electrons can move through a material, creating a better electrical conductor.

In practical terms, resistance determines how easily electric current can flow through a material. Materials with low resistance, such as metals like copper and aluminum, allow electrons to move freely, making them excellent conductors of electricity. Conversely, materials with high resistance, like rubber or glass, impede electron movement and are considered electrical insulators.

### The Physics of Electron Movement

At the atomic level, electrical conductivity depends on how easily electrons can move between atoms. Metals have a unique atomic structure with loosely bound outer electrons that can easily migrate, creating a "sea of electrons" that readily conducts electricity. This is why metals typically have low resistance and high conductivity.
