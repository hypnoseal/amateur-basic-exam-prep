question: "On 630 metres and 2200 metres, what key antenna characteristic must be taken into account to comply with power limitations expressed as equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP)?"
answers:
  - text: "Gain"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Antenna gain directly affects the Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP), which measures the total power radiated in the most favored direction compared to an ideal isotropic antenna. Since EIRP accounts for both transmitter power output and antenna gain, understanding and calculating antenna gain is critical for compliance with power limitations on these extremely low frequency (ELF) bands."
  - text: "Bandwidth"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Bandwidth describes the range of frequencies an antenna can effectively transmit or receive, but it does not directly impact EIRP calculations. While bandwidth is important for signal transmission, it does not determine the power radiation characteristics that EIRP measures."
  - text: "Impedance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Antenna impedance relates to the matching between the transmitter and antenna, affecting signal transfer efficiency, but it does not directly influence EIRP calculations. Impedance is important for power transfer but does not determine the directional power radiation that EIRP describes."
  - text: "Resonance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Resonance describes the frequency at which an antenna operates most efficiently, but it does not directly impact EIRP calculations. While resonance affects antenna performance, it does not determine the directional power radiation characteristics measured by EIRP."

## The Concept: EIRP and Antenna Gain

Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) is a measurement that describes the total power an antenna radiates in its most effective direction, compared to a theoretical perfect omnidirectional antenna (isotropic radiator). Unlike simple transmitter output power, EIRP accounts for both the transmitter's power and the antenna's ability to concentrate that power in a specific direction.

An antenna with gain effectively "focuses" radio waves, like a lens concentrating light. This means that even with the same transmitter power, antennas with different gains will radiate power differently. On extremely low frequency bands like 630m (472-479 kHz) and 2200m (135.7-137.8 kHz), understanding this gain becomes critical for regulatory compliance.

### Why Gain Matters on ELF Bands

Extremely low frequency bands have unique challenges:
- Very large wavelengths (approximately 630m = 630 meters long!)
- Extremely limited power allocations
- Significant challenges in antenna construction and efficiency
- Strict regulatory limitations to prevent interference

These constraints make antenna gain a crucial factor in managing radiated power.
