question: "What voltage is needed to supply a current of 200 milliamperes to operate a relay that has a resistance of 25 ohms?"
answers:
  - text: "5 volts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), we calculate the voltage by multiplying the current (0.2 amperes) by the resistance (25 ohms), which results in exactly 5 volts. This represents the precise voltage required to drive the specified current through the relay's resistance."
  - text: "8 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage would be too high for the given resistance and current. Applying 8 volts to a 25-ohm relay would cause a current of 0.32 amperes (8 ÷ 25), which exceeds the specified 200 milliamperes and could potentially damage the relay."
  - text: "0.5 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage is insufficient to drive the specified current through the relay. At 0.5 volts across 25 ohms, the current would only be 0.02 amperes (20 milliamperes), which is far too low to operate the relay effectively."
  - text: "50 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage would be excessive for the relay. Applying 50 volts to a 25-ohm relay would generate a current of 2 amperes (50 ÷ 25), which is ten times the specified current and would likely destroy the relay through overheating."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Electrical Calculations

**Ohm's Law** is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The basic formula V = I × R allows us to calculate any of these three values when the other two are known. In amateur radio, this law is crucial for designing circuits, understanding power requirements, and ensuring safe operation of electrical components.

In this specific example, we're dealing with a relay - an electromechanical switch common in many amateur radio applications. Relays are used to control high-power circuits, antenna switching, and various station automation tasks. The key to proper relay operation is supplying the correct voltage to generate the required current through its internal resistance.

### Breaking Down the Calculation

To find the required voltage, we use the three given parameters:
- **Current (I)**: 200 milliamperes (0.2 amperes)
- **Resistance (R)**: 25 ohms
- **Voltage (V)**: To be calculated using V = I × R

Mathematically: V = 0.2 A × 25 Ω = 5 volts

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Voltage Applications:
- **Precise Relay Operation**: Applying exactly 5 volts ensures the relay operates at its designed current
- **Battery-Powered Circuits**: Using a 5V power supply matches the relay's requirements perfectly
- **Controlled Current Flow**: Maintaining the specified current prevents relay overheating or underperformance

### ❌ Incorrect Voltage Scenarios:
- **Undervoltage**: Less than 5V won't provide enough current to activate the relay
- **Overvoltage**: More than 5V will cause excessive current and potential component damage
- **Uncontrolled Power Supply**: Using an unregulated power source can lead to unpredictable relay behavior
