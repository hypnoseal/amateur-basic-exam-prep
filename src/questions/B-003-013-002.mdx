question: "You are using an FM repeater configured for 5 kHz deviation, but your transmitter is set to 2.5 kHz deviation. What is the consequence?"
answers:
  - text: "Your audio will be low"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When your transmitter's deviation is set lower than the repeater's configured deviation, the audio signal's amplitude will be reduced proportionally. In this case, with the repeater expecting 5 kHz deviation but your transmitter only providing 2.5 kHz, the transmitted audio will sound quieter and less robust, potentially making it harder for other stations to hear you clearly."
  - text: "Your audio will be distorted"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Deviation mismatch typically results in reduced audio volume, not distortion. Distortion occurs when the audio signal exceeds the designed deviation limits, causing clipping or nonlinear compression, which is not happening in this scenario."
  - text: "Your range will be shorter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While lower deviation might slightly reduce signal clarity, it doesn't directly cause a shorter range. FM signals are more dependent on signal-to-noise ratio and receiver sensitivity than deviation level."
  - text: "The repeater will not respond"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The repeater will still receive and retransmit your signal; it won't completely reject a transmission just because the deviation is lower than its configured level. The signal will simply be weaker and less intelligible."

# FM Deviation in Amateur Radio: Understanding Signal Strength and Clarity

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

## The Concept: FM Deviation and Signal Transmission

Frequency Modulation (FM) transmits information by varying the frequency of a carrier signal. **Deviation** represents the maximum frequency swing away from the carrier frequency, directly correlating to the audio signal's amplitude and clarity.

In amateur radio repeater systems, standard deviation is typically 5 kHz for voice communications. This means the carrier frequency can shift up to 5 kilohertz above and below its center frequency to represent audio information. When your transmitter provides less deviation than the repeater expects, the audio signal becomes proportionally weaker.

### Why Deviation Matters

Think of deviation like the volume knob on a stereo. Just as turning down the volume makes music harder to hear, reducing deviation makes your radio signal less robust. The signal reaches the repeater, but with reduced audio strength that can make communication less effective.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Deviation Settings:
- **Standard Repeater**: Configured for 5 kHz deviation, with transmitters matched to this standard
- **Clear Communication**: Full audio range, strong signal penetration
- **Consistent Performance**: All stations sound equally clear and loud

### ❌ Mismatched Deviation Scenarios:
- **Reduced Deviation (2.5 kHz)**: Audio sounds quieter, less dynamic
- **Excessive Deviation (>5 kHz)**: Potential signal distortion and adjacent channel interference
- **Inconsistent Station Performance**: Some operators sound louder or clearer than others

## Practical Applications

### For Repeater Users:
1. **Check Transmitter Settings**: Verify your radio's deviation matches the repeater's standard
2. **Use Calibration Tools**: Many modern radios have deviation test modes
3. **Listen to Your Own Transmission**: Ask other operators about your audio quality

### For Different Radio Types:
1. **Handheld Radios**: Often have adjustable deviation settings
2. **Mobile Radios**: Usually preset with standard deviation
3. **Base Stations**: Typically most flexible in deviation adjustment
