question: "What causes splatter interference?"
answers:
  - text: "Overmodulating a transmitter"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Overmodulation occurs when the audio input signal's amplitude exceeds the transmitter's designed modulation capacity, causing the signal to be distorted beyond its assigned bandwidth. This creates 'splatter' - unwanted sidebands that extend beyond the intended frequency allocation, potentially interfering with adjacent frequency channels and violating amateur radio spectrum usage regulations."
  - text: "Keying a transmitter too fast"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Keying speed affects the width of digital mode signals and can create key clicks, but it does not directly cause splatter interference. Splatter is specifically related to amplitude and modulation characteristics, not transmission timing or keying rate. Fast keying might create other types of interference, but not the broad spectral spread associated with splatter."
  - text: "Unwanted feedback in an amplifier stage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Amplifier feedback typically creates different interference problems like oscillation or signal distortion, but it does not generate the characteristic wide-bandwidth splatter associated with overmodulation. Feedback might cause signal instability, but it won't produce the significant spectral spreading seen in splatter interference."
  - text: "The transmitting antenna is non-resonant"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A non-resonant antenna affects signal efficiency and can cause high SWR, but it does not directly cause splatter interference. While a poor antenna match might create some signal imperfections, splatter is fundamentally an issue of transmitter modulation, not antenna characteristics."

## The Concept: Radio Signal Modulation and Bandwidth

**Splatter interference** represents a critical problem in radio communications where a transmitted signal occupies significantly more bandwidth than it should. Think of modulation like pouring water into a glass - when you pour too quickly, the water spills over the edges, creating a messy spread. Similarly, overmodulating a transmitter causes the signal to "spill" beyond its assigned frequency allocation.

In amateur radio, each mode and frequency band has a specific allocated bandwidth. Proper modulation means keeping your signal precisely within these boundaries. When modulation exceeds the transmitter's design limits, the signal develops additional, unwanted sidebands that can interfere with nearby communications.

### The Physics of Overmodulation

When an audio signal is used to modulate a radio frequency carrier, it should ideally vary the carrier's amplitude proportionally. Overmodulation occurs when the modulating signal's amplitude is too large, causing the carrier wave to be compressed, stretched, or effectively "clipped" at its peaks. This distortion creates harmonic and intermodulation products that spread far beyond the intended signal bandwidth.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Preventing Splatter Interference:
- **Proper Microphone Technique**: Maintaining consistent audio levels and avoiding shouting
- **Using Compression Carefully**: Applying speech compression without exceeding modulation limits
- **Regular Transmitter Calibration**: Ensuring modulation circuits remain within specification

### ❌ Scenarios Causing Splatter:
- **Speaking Too Loudly**: Dramatically varying audio input levels
- **Misconfigured Transmitter Gain**: Incorrectly set microphone or processor levels
- **Damaged Modulation Circuitry**: Components that can't handle expected signal variations
