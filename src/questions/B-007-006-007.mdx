question: "At what point in the solar cycle does the 20-metre band usually support worldwide propagation during daylight hours?"
answers:
  - text: "At any point in the solar cycle"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The 20-metre band (14 MHz) is considered one of the most stable and reliable amateur radio bands, offering consistent worldwide propagation characteristics across different solar cycle phases. Its unique ionospheric propagation characteristics mean it can support long-distance communication during daylight hours regardless of solar activity, making it a favorite among amateur radio operators for global communication."
  - text: "Only at the minimum point of the solar cycle"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the 20-metre band's performance can vary with solar activity, it does not require solar cycle minimum conditions to support worldwide propagation. In fact, the band remains quite effective across different solar cycle phases, with slight variations in maximum usable frequency and signal strength."
  - text: "Only at the maximum point of the solar cycle"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Contrary to this claim, the 20-metre band does not require solar cycle maximum conditions to support worldwide communication. During solar maximum, while higher frequencies might open up, the 20-metre band remains consistently reliable for global daylight propagation."
  - text: "At the beginning of the solar cycle"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 20-metre band's propagation is not limited to the beginning of the solar cycle. Its ability to support worldwide communication during daylight hours is a consistent characteristic across different stages of solar activity."

# 20-Metre Band Propagation: A Consistent Global Communication Channel

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

## The Concept: Ionospheric Propagation and the 20-Metre Band

The 20-metre band (14-14.350 MHz) occupies a unique sweet spot in amateur radio propagation. Unlike higher or lower frequency bands that are more sensitive to solar cycle variations, this band offers remarkably consistent worldwide communication capabilities during daylight hours.

Ionospheric propagation depends on the ionization of the Earth's upper atmosphere, which is influenced by solar activity. The F-layer of the ionosphere, responsible for most long-distance HF communication, reflects radio waves back to Earth. The 20-metre band's frequency range allows it to interact optimally with this layer, providing stable skip distances across different solar conditions.

### The Solar Cycle's Impact

The solar cycle, typically lasting approximately 11 years, represents variations in solar activity marked by changes in sunspot numbers and solar radiation. While this cycle significantly affects radio propagation, the 20-metre band demonstrates exceptional resilience, maintaining its propagation characteristics across different solar cycle phases.
