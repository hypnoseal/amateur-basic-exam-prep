question: "If ten resistors of equal value \"R\" are wired in parallel, what formula yields the total resistance?"
answers:
  - text: "R / 10"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors of equal value are connected in parallel, the total resistance is calculated by dividing the individual resistor value by the total number of resistors. This is because parallel resistors create additional paths for current flow, which reduces the overall resistance of the circuit. In this case, with ten identical resistors, the total resistance becomes R/10, making the circuit have a lower total resistance than any individual resistor."
  - text: "10 / R"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This formula inverts the correct approach to calculating parallel resistance. The result would give an incorrect and much larger resistance value, which doesn't reflect how parallel circuits actually reduce overall resistance. When resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is always less than the smallest individual resistor."
  - text: "10 x R"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Multiplying the number of resistors by the individual resistance would dramatically increase the total resistance, which is the opposite of what happens in a parallel circuit. Parallel connections reduce resistance by providing multiple current paths, so the total resistance would be smaller than a single resistor, not larger."
  - text: "10 + R"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Simply adding the number of resistors to the individual resistance value does not correctly calculate parallel resistance. This method would not account for the way parallel circuits distribute current and reduce overall circuit resistance. Parallel resistance calculation requires a specific formula that reflects the multiple current paths created by the connection."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance Fundamentals

In a parallel circuit, electrical components are connected across the same two points, creating multiple independent paths for current flow. When resistors are wired in parallel, each resistor receives the same voltage, but the total current is divided among these paths. This unique configuration results in a total resistance that is always lower than any individual resistor's resistance.

The fundamental principle of parallel resistance is that adding more paths reduces the overall resistance of the circuit. Imagine water flowing through multiple pipes of the same diameter - more pipes mean easier overall flow, just as more parallel resistors mean easier current movement.

### The Mathematical Principle

For identical resistors in parallel, the total resistance formula is remarkably simple: **divide the individual resistor value by the number of resistors**. In mathematical notation, if you have ten resistors of value R, the total resistance (Rtotal) becomes R/10.

This occurs because each additional parallel path provides another route for current, effectively "splitting" the total current and reducing the circuit's overall resistance. The more parallel paths you add, the lower the total resistance becomes.
