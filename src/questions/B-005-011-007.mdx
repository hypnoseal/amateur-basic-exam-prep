question: "A transformer primary winding consumes 10 watts. Neglecting losses, if the secondary voltage is 5 volts, what is the secondary current?"
answers:
  - text: "2 amperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In an ideal transformer (neglecting losses), power in the primary equals power in the secondary. With 10 watts input and 5 volts output, the secondary current can be calculated by dividing the primary power by the secondary voltage: 10 watts ÷ 5 volts = 2 amperes. This follows the fundamental power relationship of P = VI (Power = Voltage × Current)."
  - text: "0.5 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current would only require 2.5 watts (0.5A × 5V), which is less than the 10 watts consumed by the primary, violating the conservation of energy principle for an ideal transformer."
  - text: "1 ampere"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current would only generate 5 watts (1A × 5V) on the secondary side, which is insufficient to match the 10 watts consumed by the primary winding, making this an incorrect solution."
  - text: "5 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current would generate 25 watts (5A × 5V), which exceeds the 10 watts input to the primary, violating the principle of energy conservation in an ideal transformer."

## The Concept: Energy Conservation in Transformers

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits through electromagnetic induction. In an ideal transformer (one with no losses), the power input to the primary winding exactly equals the power output from the secondary winding. This is a direct application of the conservation of energy principle.

The key relationship is simple: Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) × Current (Amperes). When one value changes, the others must adjust to maintain the same total power. In this scenario, we have a primary winding consuming 10 watts, and we're asked to determine the secondary current at 5 volts.

### Calculating Transformer Output

Using the power equation P = VI, we can rearrange to solve for current:
- Input Power = 10 watts
- Secondary Voltage = 5 volts
- Secondary Current = Input Power ÷ Secondary Voltage
- Secondary Current = 10 watts ÷ 5 volts = 2 amperes

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Ideal Transformer Power Transfer:
- **10W Input, 5V Output**: 10 watts ÷ 5 volts = 2 amperes
- **50W Input, 10V Output**: 50 watts ÷ 10 volts = 5 amperes
- **20W Input, 4V Output**: 20 watts ÷ 4 volts = 5 amperes

### ❌ Incorrect Power Transfer Scenarios:
- **Violating Energy Conservation**: Attempting to get more power out than was put in
- **Misunderstanding Voltage-Current Relationship**: Assuming voltage and current can change independently
