question: "A current of one quarter ampere may be written as:"
answers:
  - text: "250 milliamperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "One quarter (1/4) of an ampere is equal to 250 milliamperes. This conversion involves understanding metric prefixes: 1 ampere = 1000 milliamperes, so 0.25 amperes × 1000 = 250 milliamperes. The key is recognizing how to convert between units by multiplying or dividing by the appropriate power of 10."
  - text: "2.5 milliamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is incorrect. 2.5 milliamperes is significantly less than one quarter ampere. When converting 1/4 ampere to milliamperes, the result is 250 milliamperes, not 2.5 milliamperes."
  - text: "0.25 milliamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because 0.25 milliamperes is a much smaller current than one quarter ampere. When converting between units, one quarter ampere becomes 250 milliamperes, not 0.25 milliamperes."
  - text: "250 microamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. 250 microamperes is a much smaller current than one quarter ampere. Microamperes are 1/1,000,000 of an ampere, whereas one quarter ampere converts to 250 milliamperes (1/1,000 of an ampere)."

# Understanding Current Measurements: Conversion and Metric Prefixes

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How to convert between different metric current units
- The relationship between amperes, milliamperes, and microamperes
- The importance of precise unit conversion in amateur radio
- Practical applications of current measurement in electronic circuits

## The Concept: Metric Prefix Conversions

Current is typically measured in amperes (A), with metric prefixes used to represent smaller or larger quantities. Understanding these conversions is crucial for precise electronic measurements and communications.

The metric system uses standardized prefixes that represent specific multipliers:
- 1 milliampere (mA) = 0.001 amperes
- 1 microampere (µA) = 0.000001 amperes

These conversions follow a consistent pattern: each prefix represents a power of 10, making calculations straightforward once you understand the basic relationships.

### Conversion Principles

When converting between units, you multiply or divide by powers of 10. For example:
- To convert from amperes to milliamperes, multiply by 1000
- To convert from milliamperes to amperes, divide by 1000

This systematic approach ensures accurate measurements in electronic and radio circuits.
