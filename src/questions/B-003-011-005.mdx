question: "In what emission mode does the instantaneous amplitude (envelope) of the RF signal vary with the modulating audio?"
answers:
  - text: "Amplitude modulation"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In amplitude modulation (AM), the amplitude of the radio frequency carrier wave changes proportionally with the audio signal's instantaneous voltage. This means the height (amplitude) of the RF wave rises and falls exactly in sync with the modulating audio waveform, while the carrier frequency remains constant. The envelope of the RF signal directly reflects the shape of the original audio signal, creating a direct mathematical relationship between the audio input and the transmitted radio wave."
  - text: "Frequency modulation"
    correct: false
    explanation: "In frequency modulation (FM), the frequency of the carrier wave changes in response to the audio signal, not its amplitude. The amplitude remains constant while the carrier wave's frequency varies, representing a fundamentally different modulation technique from amplitude modulation. In FM, the audio signal causes frequency deviation rather than amplitude variation."
  - text: "Pulse modulation"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Pulse modulation involves varying the characteristics of discrete pulses, such as pulse width, position, or amplitude. Unlike continuous wave amplitude modulation, pulse modulation works with discrete signal segments and does not create a continuous variation of the RF signal's envelope with the audio signal."
  - text: "Frequency shift keying"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Frequency shift keying (FSK) is a digital modulation technique where discrete frequencies represent binary data states (typically 0 and 1). Unlike AM, FSK does not create a continuous amplitude variation that matches an analog audio signal, but instead switches between fixed frequencies to represent digital information."

## The Concept: Amplitude Modulation Fundamentals

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a method of combining an audio signal with a radio frequency carrier wave where the carrier's amplitude varies proportionally with the instantaneous voltage of the audio signal. Imagine the RF carrier wave as a smooth, consistent wave that gets "squeezed" and "stretched" by the audio signal, with the wave's height changing to match the audio's voltage.

At its core, AM creates a direct, real-time mapping between the audio signal's voltage and the radio frequency signal's amplitude. This means that if you were to look at an AM signal on an oscilloscope, you would see the carrier wave's envelope perfectly tracing the shape of the original audio waveform.

### The Physics of Signal Transformation

When an audio signal is applied to an AM transmitter, the process involves:
- A stable, high-frequency carrier wave (typically in the kHz or MHz range)
- An audio input signal with varying voltage
- Modulation circuitry that varies the carrier wave's amplitude in proportion to the audio signal

The result is a radio wave whose instantaneous amplitude reflects the audio signal's voltage at every moment in time.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Amplitude Modulation in Practice:
- **AM Radio Broadcasting**: Traditional AM radio stations use this technique to transmit voice and music
- **Vintage Communication Systems**: Early radio and telegraph systems relied heavily on amplitude modulation
- **Simple Wireless Communication Devices**: Some low-complexity communication systems still use AM for signal transmission

### ❌ Modulation Techniques That Are Not AM:
- **FM Radio**: Frequency varies, amplitude remains constant
- **Digital Modulation**: Uses discrete signal states rather than continuous amplitude variation
- **Single Sideband (SSB)**: A specialized form of AM that eliminates the carrier wave
