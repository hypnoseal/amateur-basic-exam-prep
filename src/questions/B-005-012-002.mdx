question: "At resonance, what impedance does a parallel tuned circuit exhibit?"
answers:
  - text: "High impedance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "At resonance, a parallel LC circuit exhibits extremely high impedance. This occurs because the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out, leaving only the circuit's resistance. At the precise resonant frequency, the inductor and capacitor create an open circuit-like condition with very high impedance, effectively blocking current flow through the circuit."
  - text: "Low impedance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. At resonance, a parallel tuned circuit actually demonstrates high impedance, not low impedance. The cancellation of reactive components creates a condition where the circuit strongly resists current flow at the resonant frequency."
  - text: "Impedance equal to reactance of the circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "At resonance, the reactive components (inductance and capacitance) cancel each other out, so the impedance is not determined by reactance. Instead, the circuit's impedance is primarily determined by its resistance, resulting in a high impedance condition."
  - text: "Impedance equal to resistance of the circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the circuit's resistance plays a role, at resonance the impedance is significantly higher than the circuit's resistance due to the interaction between the inductor and capacitor creating a near-open circuit condition."

## The Concept: Resonance in Parallel Circuits

A parallel tuned circuit is an electrical network composed of an inductor and capacitor connected in parallel, which exhibits unique behavior at its resonant frequency. Resonance occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances exactly cancel each other out, creating a fascinating electrical phenomenon that is critical in many radio frequency applications.

At the precise resonant frequency, the inductor and capacitor create opposite but equal reactive effects. The inductive reactance (XL) becomes equal to the capacitive reactance (XC), but with opposite phase. This cancellation leaves the circuit with an extremely high impedance, effectively blocking current flow at that specific frequency.

### The Resonance Mechanism

Imagine two swimmers trying to move through water in opposite directions with equal strength. At the moment they perfectly balance each other, they create a stationary point of maximum resistance. In a parallel tuned circuit, the electrical components create a similar "standing wave" of impedance, resulting in very high circuit resistance to current flow.
