question: "Your transceiver's user guide suggests limiting the voltage drop to 0.5 volts and the vehicle battery is 3 metres away. Given the losses listed below at the required current of 22 amperes, which minimum wire gauge must you use?"
answers:
  - text: "Number 10, 0.07 V per metre"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Number 10 AWG wire is the correct choice because it has a voltage drop of 0.07 V per metre, which allows the total voltage drop over 3 metres to be 0.21 volts (0.07 V × 3 m), well below the 0.5-volt maximum specified by the transceiver's user guide. At 22 amperes, this wire gauge provides sufficient current-carrying capacity while maintaining an acceptably low voltage drop."
  - text: "Number 14, 0.19 V per metre"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Number 14 AWG wire would be inadequate for this application. With a voltage drop of 0.19 V per metre, the total voltage drop over 3 metres would be 0.57 volts (0.19 V × 3 m), which exceeds the 0.5-volt maximum specified by the transceiver's user guide. This wire gauge is too thin to handle the 22-ampere current while maintaining the required low voltage drop."
  - text: "Number 12, 0.11 V per metre"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Number 12 AWG wire would result in a total voltage drop of 0.33 volts (0.11 V × 3 m), which is within the specified limit. However, Number 10 AWG provides an even lower voltage drop of 0.21 volts, making it the more optimal choice for this application."
  - text: "Number 8, 0.05 V per metre"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While Number 8 AWG wire would provide an extremely low voltage drop of 0.15 volts (0.05 V × 3 m), it is unnecessarily thick for this application. Number 10 AWG provides sufficient current-carrying capacity and meets the voltage drop requirements more efficiently and cost-effectively."

# Vehicle Power Wiring: Understanding Voltage Drop and Wire Gauge Selection

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How wire gauge affects electrical system performance
- The relationship between wire thickness, current, and voltage drop
- Principles of selecting appropriate wire for mobile radio installations
- Practical considerations in automotive electrical systems

## The Concept: Voltage Drop and Wire Resistance

Electrical current flowing through a wire encounters resistance, which causes a voltage drop along the wire's length. This phenomenon is critical in mobile radio installations, where power must be efficiently transferred from a battery to electronic equipment.

The key factors affecting voltage drop are:
- Wire length
- Wire cross-sectional area (gauge)
- Current being drawn
- Wire material (typically copper)

A lower gauge number indicates a thicker wire with lower resistance. For amateur radio mobile installations, selecting the correct wire gauge is crucial to ensure stable power delivery and prevent performance issues.

### Why Voltage Drop Matters

Excessive voltage drop can cause:
- Reduced equipment performance
- Potential damage to sensitive electronics
- Increased heat generation in the wire
- Inefficient power transmission

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Wire Gauge Selection:
- **Mobile HF Transceiver**: Using Number 10 AWG for a 22-ampere draw over 3 metres
- **VHF/UHF Mobile Radio**: Matching wire gauge to current requirements
- **Emergency Communications Vehicle**: Ensuring reliable power delivery

### ❌ Incorrect Wire Gauge Problems:
- **Undersized Wire**: Voltage drop causing intermittent radio operation
- **Oversized Wire**: Unnecessary cost and installation complexity
- **Mismatched Wire**: Potential safety hazards from excessive heat generation

## Practical Applications

### For Mobile Radio Installations:
1. **Measure Current Draw**: Accurately determine maximum current requirements
2. **Calculate Total Wire Length**: Include both positive and ground connections
3. **Select Appropriate Wire Gauge**: Choose based on current and voltage drop specifications

### Wire Selection Guidelines:
1. **Short Runs (< 2 metres)**: Can use slightly thinner wire
2. **Long Runs (> 3 metres)**: Require thicker wire to minimize voltage drop
3. **High-Power Devices**: Always err on the side of a thicker wire gauge
