question: "Based on the frequency stated and emission mode, which of the following combinations is prohibited?"
answers:
  - text: "Fast-scan television (ATV) on 145 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Fast-scan television is prohibited on the 2-meter (145 MHz) band for Basic-level amateur radio operators in Canada. This restriction is part of the frequency allocation and operating privileges specific to different license classes. While ATV is permitted on the 70-centimeter (440 MHz) band, the 2-meter band is primarily designated for voice, digital, and narrowband modes for Basic licensees."
  - text: "FT8 on 14.074 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FT8 is a digital mode that is fully permitted on the 20-meter band (14 MHz). This frequency is within the designated digital mode segments and is compatible with Basic amateur radio operator privileges. The digital mode is narrow-bandwidth and does not interfere with other station operations."
  - text: "Morse radiotelegraphy (CW) on 10.145 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Morse code (CW) on 10.145 MHz is permitted and falls within the 30-meter band's digital and CW segment. This mode is allowed for Basic-level amateur radio operators and is a popular communication method for long-distance, low-power communication."
  - text: "Fast-scan television (ATV) on 440 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Fast-scan television (ATV) on the 70-centimeter (440 MHz) band is explicitly permitted for amateur radio operators. This band is commonly used for amateur television and provides wider bandwidth for video transmission compared to other bands."

# Frequency Allocation and Emission Modes: Understanding Amateur Radio Band Usage

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How amateur radio bands are allocated for different communication modes
- The specific restrictions on 2-meter band operations for Basic-level licensees
- The importance of frequency and mode compatibility
- How different amateur radio license levels affect operating privileges

## The Concept: Frequency Allocation and Operating Modes

Amateur radio frequency bands are carefully managed resources with specific allocations for different communication modes. These allocations are designed to maximize spectrum efficiency, minimize interference, and provide appropriate communication channels for various amateur radio activities.

For Basic-level amateur radio operators in Canada, certain bands and modes have specific restrictions. These limitations are not arbitrary but are carefully designed to balance the needs of different operators, prevent interference, and provide a structured approach to spectrum use.

### Frequency Allocation Principles

Each amateur radio band has characteristics that make it suitable for different types of communication. Factors like signal propagation, bandwidth requirements, and potential for interference guide these allocations. Basic-level operators typically have more restricted privileges compared to higher-level license holders.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Permitted Combinations:
- **FT8 on 14 MHz**: Digital mode on 20-meter band, fully compatible with Basic license
- **CW on 10 MHz**: Morse code operation within designated segments
- **ATV on 440 MHz**: Fast-scan television permitted on 70-centimeter band

### ❌ Prohibited or Restricted Combinations:
- **ATV on 145 MHz**: Prohibited for Basic-level operators
- **Modes outside allocated segments**
- **High-power transmissions beyond Basic license limits**

## Practical Applications

### For New Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Consult Frequency Charts**: Always reference current band plan charts
2. **Understand License Limitations**: Know your specific operating privileges
3. **Use Appropriate Modes**: Match your communication method to band characteristics

### For Band-Specific Operations:
1. **2-Meter Band (145 MHz)**: Primarily for voice, digital, and narrowband modes
2. **70-Centimeter Band (440 MHz)**: More flexible, allows ATV and wider modes
3. **Digital Mode Considerations**: Understand bandwidth and frequency segment requirements

### Memory Aid:
"**B**asic **L**icense **M**eans **M**oderate **M**odes" - Remember your Basic license has mode and band limitations.
