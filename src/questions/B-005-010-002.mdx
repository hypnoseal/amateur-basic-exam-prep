question: "How does a capacitor react to AC?"
answers:
  - text: "As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases"
    correct: true
    explanation: "As AC frequency increases, a capacitor's reactance (opposition to current flow) decreases according to the formula Xc = 1/(2πfC). This means higher frequencies encounter less resistance through the capacitor, allowing more current to flow. This behavior is fundamental to how capacitors function in electronic circuits, acting like a frequency-dependent current pathway."
  - text: "As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. In fact, capacitor reactance moves in the opposite direction - as frequency increases, reactance decreases. This is why capacitors become more 'transparent' to higher frequency signals, allowing more current to pass through at higher frequencies."
  - text: "As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Capacitor reactance is independent of signal amplitude. The opposition to current flow (reactance) depends on frequency and capacitance value, not on the strength of the AC signal. Changing the amplitude does not alter the capacitor's electrical characteristics."
  - text: "As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Amplitude changes do not affect a capacitor's reactance. The opposition to current flow remains constant for a given frequency and capacitance, regardless of the signal's strength or amplitude."

## The Concept: Capacitive Reactance and Frequency

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material. When alternating current (AC) is applied, the capacitor's behavior is characterized by its **reactance** - a measure of how much it opposes current flow.

Unlike resistors, which provide constant opposition to current, capacitors' resistance varies with frequency. The key formula describing this relationship is **Xc = 1/(2πfC)**:
- Xc = Capacitive Reactance (in ohms)
- f = Frequency (in Hertz)
- C = Capacitance (in Farads)

This equation reveals a fundamental inverse relationship: as frequency increases, reactance decreases. Imagine a "current gate" that becomes more open as signals oscillate faster.

### Why Reactance Changes with Frequency

At low frequencies, capacitors act like near-insulators, blocking most current. As frequency rises, the capacitor's plates can charge and discharge more quickly, allowing more current to flow. It's similar to a water valve that opens wider as the water pulses more rapidly.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Frequency-Dependent Capacitor Behaviors:
- **Audio Crossover Networks**: Use capacitors to filter different sound frequencies
- **RF Circuits**: Employ capacitors as high-pass or low-pass filters
- **Power Supply Smoothing**: Capacitors filter out high-frequency noise more effectively at higher frequencies

### ❌ Misconceptions about Capacitor Behavior:
- Believing capacitor reactance is constant across all frequencies
- Thinking amplitude changes reactance
- Assuming capacitors block all AC equally

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Design:
1. **Filter Design**: Create frequency-selective circuits by choosing appropriate capacitance values
2. **Signal Conditioning**: Use capacitors to remove unwanted frequency components
3. **Impedance Matching**: Leverage frequency-dependent behavior in communication systems

### For Amateur Radio:
1. **Noise Filtering**: Reduce high-frequency interference in receiver circuits
2. **Antenna Matching**: Use capacitors in impedance transformation networks
3. **Signal Coupling**: Transfer signals between circuit stages while blocking DC

### Memory Aid:
"**F**aster **F**requency = **F**ewer **F**riction" - As frequency increases, capacitor reactance decreases.
