question: "How can a transformer with two windings change impedance?"
answers:
  - text: "By carrying different voltages and currents in each winding"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A transformer changes impedance through the relationship between its primary and secondary windings. The voltage and current ratios between windings create a corresponding impedance transformation based on the square of the turns ratio. By having different numbers of turns in the primary and secondary windings, the transformer can step voltages up or down while simultaneously changing the impedance seen by the circuit."
  - text: "By using the correct magnetic coupling between windings"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While good magnetic coupling is crucial for transformer efficiency, it doesn't directly change impedance. Magnetic coupling affects how effectively energy transfers between windings, but the impedance transformation is determined by the winding turns ratio, not the coupling quality."
  - text: "By allowing the difference to be dissipated in core losses"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Core losses are an unwanted side effect of transformer operation that reduce efficiency, not a mechanism for impedance transformation. These losses represent energy converted to heat in the transformer core and do not contribute to deliberate impedance changes."
  - text: "By matching winding resistance to impedance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Winding resistance is a physical characteristic of the wire used in the transformer and doesn't directly control impedance transformation. Impedance change is primarily determined by the turns ratio between primary and secondary windings, not the resistance of those windings."

## The Concept: Impedance Transformation in Transformers

A transformer is an electromagnetic device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits through magnetic coupling. Its most remarkable property is the ability to change voltage, current, and impedance simultaneously without any moving parts.

The key to impedance transformation lies in the relationship between the primary and secondary windings. When you apply a voltage to the primary winding, the number of turns in each winding determines how the voltage, current, and impedance are modified. This transformation follows a precise mathematical relationship based on the turns ratio.

### The Turns Ratio Principle

Imagine a transformer with 10 turns on the primary winding and 100 turns on the secondary winding. If you apply 10V to the primary, you'll get 100V on the secondary. Simultaneously, the current and impedance will be transformed inversely. This means a low current on the primary becomes a higher current on the secondary, with the impedance changing by the square of the turns ratio.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Effective Impedance Transformation:
- **Antenna Matching**: Using a transformer to match a 50Ω radio output to a 450Ω antenna system
- **Audio Impedance Matching**: Connecting low-impedance microphones to high-impedance audio systems
- **Power Supply Design**: Matching different voltage and current requirements in electronic circuits

### ❌ Misunderstandings About Transformer Operation:
- **Believing Transformers Create Energy**: Transformers transfer energy, not create it
- **Assuming All Transformers Have 1:1 Turns Ratio**: Transformers can have many different turns ratios
- **Ignoring Core Losses**: Real transformers have some energy loss in the magnetic core
