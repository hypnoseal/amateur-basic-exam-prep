question: "When two 500-ohm 1-watt resistors are connected in series, the maximum total power that can be dissipated by the resistors is:"
answers:
  - text: "2 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in series, the total power dissipation is the sum of individual resistor power ratings. Each resistor is rated at 1 watt, so the total maximum power dissipation when connected in series is 2 watts. In series connection, the total resistance increases while the current remains the same across both resistors."
  - text: "1 watt"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because series connection of resistors adds their individual power ratings. Each 1-watt resistor contributes its full power rating to the total, resulting in more than 1 watt of total power dissipation."
  - text: "0.5 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is far too low and does not represent the actual power dissipation of two 1-watt resistors connected in series. The total power would be higher due to the additive nature of power ratings in series connections."
  - text: "4 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value exceeds the individual power ratings of the resistors. In series connection, resistors dissipate their rated power, but do not multiply their power ratings beyond their individual specifications."

## The Concept: Series Resistor Power Calculations

In electrical circuits, when resistors are connected in series, their total resistance increases, but the current flowing through each resistor remains constant. Power dissipation is a function of both voltage and current, calculated by the formula P = I² × R or P = V² ÷ R.

When individual resistors have the same power rating and are connected in series, their total power dissipation is simply the sum of their individual power ratings. This is because each resistor dissipates its full rated power under the same current conditions.

### Series Connection Fundamentals

In a series circuit:
- Total resistance increases
- Current remains constant through all components
- Voltage is divided proportionally across resistors
- Individual power ratings are additive

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Series Power Calculations:
- **Two 1-watt Resistors**: Total power dissipation = 2 watts
- **Three 500mW Resistors**: Total power dissipation = 1.5 watts
- **Four 250mW Resistors**: Total power dissipation = 1 watt

### ❌ Incorrect Series Power Assumptions:
- **Multiplying Power Ratings**: Incorrectly assuming series connection multiplies power
- **Reducing Power Ratings**: Believing series connection reduces total power dissipation
- **Ignoring Individual Resistor Limits**: Exceeding individual component ratings
