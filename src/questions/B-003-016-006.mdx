question: "The voltage at a battery's terminals will drop when it supplies current. What is the cause of the drop?"
answers:
  - text: "Internal resistance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Internal resistance represents the inherent resistance within a battery's chemical structure that impedes electron flow. As current is drawn, electrons must pass through this internal resistance, causing a voltage drop across the battery's internal components. This creates a small but measurable reduction in terminal voltage proportional to the current being drawn."
  - text: "Electrolyte becoming dry"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While electrolyte depletion can eventually impact battery performance, it is not the immediate cause of voltage drop when supplying current. Internal resistance is the primary mechanism causing voltage reduction during current draw, which occurs independently of electrolyte condition."
  - text: "Current capacity"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Current capacity describes the total amount of charge a battery can deliver, not the mechanism causing voltage drop. Internal resistance, not current capacity, directly causes the voltage reduction when current is supplied."
  - text: "Voltage capacity"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Voltage capacity represents the battery's nominal voltage rating, not the mechanism causing terminal voltage to drop. Internal resistance is responsible for the voltage reduction when current flows through the battery."

## The Concept: Internal Resistance in Batteries

Every battery contains an intrinsic electrical resistance within its chemical structure that opposes electron flow. This **internal resistance** is analogous to friction in mechanical systems - it represents the inherent opposition to current movement through the battery's components.

When a battery supplies current, electrons must travel through electrochemical pathways containing molecular obstacles. These obstacles create a small but measurable resistance that causes energy loss in the form of heat and a corresponding voltage drop at the battery's terminals.

Think of internal resistance like a narrow water pipe: as more water (current) flows through, more pressure (voltage) is lost due to the pipe's constriction. Similarly, as more electrical current flows through a battery, more voltage is lost across its internal resistance.

### The Physics Behind Internal Resistance

The voltage drop caused by internal resistance follows Ohm's Law: V = IR, where:
- V is the voltage drop
- I is the current being drawn
- R is the internal resistance of the battery

This means that larger currents cause proportionally larger voltage drops across the battery's internal resistance.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Scenarios Demonstrating Internal Resistance:
- **High-Drain Devices**: Cameras or power tools showing reduced battery performance under heavy current draw
- **Starting a Car**: Significant voltage drop when cranking the engine, caused by high current through battery internal resistance
- **Radio Transmitters**: Voltage sag when transmitting at high power levels

### ❌ Misconceptions About Battery Voltage Drop:
- **Believing Voltage Drop Means Battery Failure**: Small voltage drops are normal and expected
- **Assuming All Batteries Have Identical Internal Resistance**: Different battery chemistries have varying internal resistance characteristics
- **Ignoring Heat Generation**: Internal resistance causes energy loss as heat, which can impact battery longevity

### For Radio Equipment:
1. **Power Supply Stability**: Understand how battery internal resistance affects voltage regulation
2. **Battery State of Health**: Use internal resistance as an indicator of battery condition
3. **Backup Power Planning**: Select batteries with appropriate internal resistance for emergency communication needs
