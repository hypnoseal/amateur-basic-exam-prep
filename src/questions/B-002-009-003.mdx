question: "While making a contact in a VHF contest, the other operator asks for your grid square. What information is requested?"
answers:
  - text: "Your location expressed as a 4 or 6-character code"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A grid square is a geographical locator system used in amateur radio, particularly for VHF and UHF communications, that divides the Earth's surface into 1° latitude by 2° longitude rectangles. This precise location code helps operators determine their relative position and calculate the distance and potential propagation path between stations. The code provides a compact way to communicate geographic location without using complex coordinate systems."
  - text: "Your antenna azimuth stated in compass degrees"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While antenna azimuth (compass direction) is important in radio communications, it is not what a grid square represents. Antenna azimuth describes the horizontal pointing direction of an antenna, whereas a grid square is a geographical location identifier that uses alphanumeric characters to represent a specific area on Earth."
  - text: "The number of contacts you have made"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Contest contacts are typically tracked separately from grid square information. The number of contacts (or 'QSOs') is a separate statistic used for scoring in amateur radio contests, not related to the geographical location represented by a grid square."
  - text: "The elevation of your station in thirty-metre increments"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While station elevation can be relevant for radio propagation, grid squares do not directly encode elevation. They represent a two-dimensional geographical location using latitude and longitude, not the height above sea level of a specific station."

## The Concept: Grid Square Locator System

The grid square system is a geographical coordinate method developed specifically for amateur radio to provide a simple, compact way of describing location. Created by the ARRL (American Radio Relay League), this system divides the Earth's surface into nested rectangular zones that can describe locations with increasing precision.

A grid square is composed of alphanumeric characters that progressively narrow down a geographical area. The first two characters represent a large 10° × 20° area (about 1,200 × 1,200 km), while additional characters can pinpoint locations with increasing precision:
- **First two characters**: Represent major global regions (letters A-R)
- **Next two digits**: Specify a smaller 1° × 2° rectangle
- **Optional third character pair**: Further refines location to about 5 × 5 km

### Practical Grid Square Structure

A typical grid square might look like:
- **4 Characters**: `CN87` (broad area)
- **6 Characters**: `CN87ab` (very specific location)

The characters systematically encode:
- Longitude (first letter)
- Latitude (second letter)
- Longitude (first number)
- Latitude (second number)
- Optional sub-square precision

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Grid Square Usage:
- **"My grid is CN87"**: Broad location identification in a contest
- **"I'm at CN87ab"**: Precise location within a small area
- **Contesting**: Quickly communicating location without complex coordinates

### ❌ Incorrect Grid Square Applications:
- **Using compass degrees instead of grid code**
- **Describing elevation separately**
- **Mixing up character order**

## Practical Applications

### For VHF/UHF Operators:
1. **Contest Communication**: Quickly exchange location information
2. **Propagation Studies**: Estimate signal path and potential contacts
3. **Satellite Communications**: Precise location tracking
4. **Digital Modes**: Automatic location exchange in modes like FT8

### For Digital Tools:
1. **Mapping Software**: Convert grid squares to precise coordinates
2. **Propagation Prediction**: Calculate potential signal paths
3. **Logging Programs**: Automatically record and validate location data
