question: "Two resistors are in parallel. Resistor \"A\" carries twice the current of resistor \"B,\" which means that:"
answers:
  - text: "\"A\" has half the resistance of \"B\""
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a parallel circuit, the voltage across all components is identical, so if resistor A carries twice the current of resistor B, it must have half the resistance. This follows directly from Ohm's Law (V = IR), where current is inversely proportional to resistance when voltage remains constant."
  - text: "the voltage across \"B\" is twice that across \"A\""
    correct: false
    explanation: "In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same. Since the voltage is identical for both resistors, this statement contradicts the fundamental principle of parallel circuit behavior."
  - text: "the voltage across \"A\" is twice that across \"B\""
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is incorrect because in a parallel circuit, all components have the same voltage across them. The voltage remains constant regardless of individual resistor characteristics."
  - text: "\"B\" has half the resistance of \"A\""
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is the inverse of the correct relationship. If resistor A carries twice the current, it must have half the resistance of resistor B, not the other way around."

## The Concept: Parallel Circuit Principles

In a parallel circuit, all components share the same voltage but can have different currents based on their individual resistances. This means that when resistors are connected in parallel, the total voltage across each resistor is identical, while the current through each resistor depends on its specific resistance value.

Ohm's Law (V = IR) is the key to understanding these relationships. When voltage remains constant, current becomes inversely proportional to resistance. This means that a resistor with lower resistance will allow more current to flow, while a resistor with higher resistance will restrict current flow.

### The Parallel Resistance Relationship

In a parallel circuit with two resistors, the relationship between current and resistance follows a simple rule: lower resistance results in higher current. Mathematically, this means that when one resistor carries more current, it must have proportionally lower resistance compared to the other resistor.
