question: "On resistors with four colour bands, which colour band differentiates two resistors rated at 33 ohms and 39 ohms respectively?"
answers:
  - text: "Second"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In the four-band resistor color code, the second band represents the multiplier digit. For a 33 ohm resistor, the color bands would be orange-orange-black-gold, while a 39 ohm resistor would have orange-white-black-gold. The difference between these resistors is in the second band, where 'orange' (3) for 33 ohms changes to 'white' (9) for 39 ohms."
  - text: "Third"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The third color band on a four-band resistor represents the multiplier (power of 10), which is black (×1) for both 33 and 39 ohm resistors. This band does not differentiate between these two resistance values."
  - text: "Fourth"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The fourth color band typically represents the tolerance (such as gold for ±5%), which is the same for both 33 and 39 ohm resistors and does not distinguish between their resistance values."
  - text: "First"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The first color band represents the first significant digit of the resistance value. For both 33 and 39 ohm resistors, this would be orange (3), so the first band does not differentiate between these two resistors."

## Learning Objectives

## The Concept: Resistor Color Coding Basics

Resistor color coding is a standardized system used to indicate the electrical resistance and tolerance of resistors. For a four-band resistor, each colored band provides specific information about the component's characteristics. The bands are read from left to right, with each color representing a specific number or multiplier.

The standard four-band color code uses the following sequence:
1. First Band: First significant digit
2. Second Band: Second significant digit
3. Third Band: Multiplier (power of 10)
4. Fourth Band: Tolerance

### How Color Translates to Numbers

Each color corresponds to a specific numeric value:
- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Gray: 8
- White: 9

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Color Code Interpretation:
- **33 Ohm Resistor**: Orange-Orange-Black-Gold (3-3-×1-±5%)
- **39 Ohm Resistor**: Orange-White-Black-Gold (3-9-×1-±5%)
- **Note the Difference**: The second band changes from Orange (3) to White (9)

### ❌ Common Misinterpretation Scenarios:
- Confusing band order
- Misreading color values
- Overlooking the multiplier band
- Ignoring tolerance information
