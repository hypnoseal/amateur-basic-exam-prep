question: "Which of these series combination of resistors would replace a single 120-ohm resistor?"
answers:
  - text: "Five 24-ohm resistors"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a series circuit, the total resistance is calculated by adding the individual resistances. Five 24-ohm resistors connected in series will produce a total resistance of 5 × 24 = 120 ohms, exactly matching the single resistor being replaced. This arrangement provides an equivalent resistance through the precise summation of individual component values."
  - text: "Six 22-ohm resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Six 22-ohm resistors connected in series would produce a total resistance of 6 × 22 = 132 ohms, which is different from the target 120-ohm resistance. This configuration would not provide a precise replacement for the original resistor."
  - text: "Two 240-ohm resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Two 240-ohm resistors in series would create a total resistance of 2 × 240 = 480 ohms, which is significantly higher than the 120-ohm target. This combination would not be an equivalent replacement."
  - text: "Five 100-ohm resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Five 100-ohm resistors connected in series would produce a total resistance of 5 × 100 = 500 ohms, which is much higher than the 120-ohm resistor being replaced. This configuration would not provide an equivalent resistance."

## The Concept: Series Resistance Fundamentals

In a series circuit, electrical components are connected end-to-end, creating a single path for current flow. When resistors are connected in series, their individual resistance values are simply added together to determine the total circuit resistance.

The fundamental rule for series resistance is straightforward: **Total Resistance = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn**. This means that each additional resistor increases the total resistance of the circuit, creating a linear relationship between the number of resistors and their combined resistance.

### The Mathematics of Series Resistance

To determine the total resistance of resistors in series, you simply add their individual values. This principle allows electronics designers to create precise resistance values by combining standard resistor components, a technique crucial in amateur radio circuit design, test equipment construction, and signal conditioning circuits.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Series Resistance Combinations:
- **Five 24-ohm resistors**: 5 × 24 = 120 ohms (exactly matches target resistance)
- **Three 40-ohm resistors**: 3 × 40 = 120 ohms (alternative method to achieve same result)
- **Two 60-ohm resistors**: 2 × 60 = 120 ohms (another equivalent configuration)

### ❌ Incorrect Series Resistance Approaches:
- **Six 22-ohm resistors**: Produces 132 ohms instead of 120 ohms
- **Two 240-ohm resistors**: Creates 480 ohms, far from target resistance
- **Parallel resistor connections**: Would reduce total resistance, not increase it
