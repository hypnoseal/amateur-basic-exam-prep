question: "What is the total resistance of four 68-ohm resistors wired in parallel?"
answers:
  - text: "17 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is calculated by dividing the individual resistor value by the number of resistors. In this case, 68 ohms ÷ 4 = 17 ohms. This follows the fundamental principle that parallel resistors reduce the overall resistance, allowing more current to flow compared to a single resistor of the same value."
  - text: "12 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value does not correctly follow the parallel resistance calculation. Parallel resistors always have a lower total resistance than the individual resistor values, but 12 ohms is not the mathematically correct result for four 68-ohm resistors."
  - text: "34 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation incorrectly doubles the individual resistor value instead of dividing it. In parallel circuits, the total resistance is always less than the smallest individual resistor value, not more."
  - text: "272 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value represents the result of multiplying the resistor values, which is incorrect for parallel circuit calculations. In parallel, resistances are divided, not multiplied, resulting in a lower total resistance."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance Principles

Parallel circuits provide an alternative path for electrical current, which fundamentally changes how resistance is calculated compared to series circuits. When resistors are connected in parallel, each resistor receives the full circuit voltage but allows a portion of the total current to flow through its individual path.

The formula for calculating total resistance in a parallel circuit is: 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + 1/R4. For identical resistors, this simplifies to dividing the individual resistor value by the number of resistors. In this case, 68 ohms ÷ 4 = 17 ohms.

### Why Parallel Reduces Resistance

Imagine water flowing through multiple pipes of the same diameter. Each additional pipe provides more total flow capacity, just as each parallel resistor provides an additional current path. This means more total current can flow, which is equivalent to lower overall resistance.
