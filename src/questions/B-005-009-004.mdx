question: "If two equal-value capacitors are connected in parallel, what is their total capacitance?"
answers:
  - text: "Twice the value of one capacitor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitor values. For two identical capacitors, this means the total capacitance will be exactly twice the value of a single capacitor. This occurs because parallel connections allow charge to accumulate across multiple capacitors simultaneously, effectively increasing the total charge storage capacity."
  - text: "Half the value of either capacitor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Parallel capacitor connections increase total capacitance, not decrease it. In a parallel configuration, the total capacitance is always greater than the value of any individual capacitor, not less."
  - text: "The value of one capacitor times 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is an overestimation. For two equal capacitors in parallel, the total capacitance is twice the value of one capacitor, not four times. Multiplying by four would require four identical capacitors connected in parallel."
  - text: "The value of one capacitor divided by 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect and represents a reduction in capacitance, which doesn't happen in parallel connections. Parallel capacitors increase total capacitance, not decrease it."

## The Concept: Parallel Capacitor Connections

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field between two conductive plates. When capacitors are connected in parallel—with their corresponding terminals connected together—they create a combined circuit that increases the total charge storage capacity.

In a parallel connection, the voltage across each capacitor remains the same, but the total capacitance increases. This means that if you have two identical capacitors connected in parallel, the total capacitance will be exactly twice the value of a single capacitor.

### The Mathematical Principle

The formula for total capacitance in a parallel circuit is simple: **Ctotal = C1 + C2 + C3...** For two equal capacitors, this means **Ctotal = C + C = 2C**, where C is the value of a single capacitor.

Think of this like filling water buckets. If you have two identical buckets and connect them so water can flow between them, you've effectively created a single container with twice the original volume.
