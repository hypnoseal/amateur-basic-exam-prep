question: "Given that red=2, violet=7 and yellow=4, what is the nominal value of a resistor whose colour code reads \"red,\" \"violet\" and \"yellow\"?"
answers:
  - text: "270 kilohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using the given color code mapping, the first two digits of the resistor value are determined by red (2) and violet (7), which gives 27. The yellow indicates the multiplier, which is 10^4 (10,000). Therefore, 27 × 10,000 = 270,000 ohms or 270 kilohms. This follows the standard resistor color code method of encoding resistance values using a sequence of colored bands."
  - text: "274 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This interpretation incorrectly applies the color code by treating yellow as a digit instead of a multiplier. It also fails to recognize the correct place value of each color in the standard resistor color code scheme."
  - text: "72 kilohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer reverses the order of the first two digits, using violet (7) as the first digit and red (2) as the second, and incorrectly applies the multiplier. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of how resistor color codes are read."
  - text: "27 megohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this answer correctly identifies 27 as the first two digits, it incorrectly interprets the yellow multiplier as 10^6 (1,000,000) instead of 10^4 (10,000), resulting in an incorrect resistance value."

## The Concept: Resistor Color Code Basics

The resistor color code is a standardized method used in electronics to represent the resistance value and tolerance of resistors using a sequence of colored bands. This system allows manufacturers to print precise resistance information on tiny components without using numbers that would be too small to read.

In the standard color code system, each color represents a specific numerical value or multiplier. The first two bands typically represent the significant digits of the resistance, while the third band indicates the multiplier (power of 10) that determines the final value. Additional bands may indicate tolerance or temperature coefficient.

### Color Code Mapping

In this specific problem, we're given a simplified mapping:
- Red = 2
- Violet = 7
- Yellow = 4 (as a multiplier)

When reading a resistor color code, you follow a left-to-right progression:
1. First band (red): First significant digit = 2
2. Second band (violet): Second significant digit = 7
3. Third band (yellow): Multiplier = 10^4 (10,000)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Color Code Interpretations:
- **Red-Violet-Yellow**: 27 × 10,000 = 270 kilohms
- **Brown-Black-Red**: 10 × 10^2 = 1 kilohm
- **Orange-Orange-Green**: 33 × 10^5 = 3.3 megohms

### ❌ Common Misinterpretation Traps:
- **Reversing Digit Order**: Reading bands in wrong sequence
- **Misunderstanding Multipliers**: Confusing multiplicative powers
- **Ignoring Significant Digits**: Treating all colors as direct values
