question: "What are the possible values of a 100-ohm resistor with a 10% tolerance?"
answers:
  - text: "90 ohms to 110 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A 10% tolerance means the actual resistance can vary up to 10% above or below the nominal value. For a 100-ohm resistor, this calculates to a range of 90 ohms (100 - 10%) to 110 ohms (100 + 10%). This variation is critical in electronic design, allowing for component manufacturing variations while maintaining predictable circuit performance."
  - text: "90 ohms to 100 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This range only covers the lower tolerance limit and the nominal value, missing the upper tolerance range. A 10% tolerance resistor can vary both above and below the nominal resistance value, so the full range extends to 110 ohms, not just 100 ohms."
  - text: "10 ohms to 100 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This range is far too broad and does not reflect the actual tolerance calculation. A 10% tolerance means the resistance varies within a narrow band around the nominal value, not across a completely arbitrary range of values."
  - text: "80 ohms to 120 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This range represents a 20% variation, which is wider than the specified 10% tolerance. A 10% tolerance resistor has a more limited range of acceptable resistance values around its nominal value."

## The Concept: Resistor Tolerance and Variation

**Resistor tolerance** is a measure of how closely a resistor's actual resistance matches its nominal (stated) value. It represents the maximum percentage deviation from the marked resistance that is considered acceptable during manufacturing. In amateur radio and electronics, understanding tolerance is crucial for designing reliable circuits that perform consistently under various conditions.

When a resistor is marked with a tolerance, it means the actual resistance can vary within a specific range around its nominal value. A 10% tolerance resistor means the actual resistance can be up to 10% higher or lower than the stated value. This variation occurs due to manufacturing processes, material variations, and other physical limitations in component production.

### Calculating Tolerance Ranges

To calculate the tolerance range, you use a simple percentage calculation:
- Lower Limit = Nominal Value - (Nominal Value × Tolerance Percentage)
- Upper Limit = Nominal Value + (Nominal Value × Tolerance Percentage)

For a 100-ohm resistor with 10% tolerance:
- Lower Limit = 100 - (100 × 0.10) = 90 ohms
- Upper Limit = 100 + (100 × 0.10) = 110 ohms

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Tolerance in Practical Circuits:
- **Voltage Divider Circuits**: Tolerances affect the precision of voltage scaling
- **Biasing Networks**: Small resistance variations can impact transistor operating points
- **Filtering Circuits**: Component variations influence filter characteristics

### ❌ Problems Caused by Ignoring Tolerance:
- **Inconsistent Circuit Performance**: Unexpected behavior due to component variations
- **Signal Distortion**: Precise analog circuits require tighter tolerance components
- **Reduced Reliability**: Wider tolerance can lead to less predictable circuit operation

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Design:
1. **Choose Appropriate Tolerance**: Select resistors based on circuit requirements
2. **Design for Variation**: Use more precise components in critical signal paths
3. **Compensate for Tolerance**: Use techniques like calibration or selecting matched components

### For Amateur Radio Construction:
1. **Understand Component Specifications**: Read and interpret resistor markings correctly
2. **Select Components Wisely**: Choose tolerances appropriate to your circuit's needs
3. **Verify Circuit Performance**: Test and measure actual circuit behavior

### Memory Aid:
"**T**olerance **M**eans **V**ariation" - Think of tolerance as the acceptable range around a component's nominal value.
