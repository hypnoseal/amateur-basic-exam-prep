question: "What is the approximate length of a delta loop antenna designed for 28.7 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "10.66 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This length represents a full wavelength delta loop antenna for 28.7 MHz. The calculation is based on the fundamental antenna design principle that the total antenna length is approximately equal to one wavelength divided by the speed of light. For 28.7 MHz, this results in a total perimeter length of around 10.66 metres, which matches the standard formula for calculating full-wavelength loop antenna dimensions."
  - text: "3.55 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is too short for a full-wavelength delta loop at 28.7 MHz. It would result in an inefficient antenna with poor radiation characteristics and significantly reduced performance on the 10-meter band."
  - text: "8.15 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While closer to the correct length than some other options, this measurement is still insufficient for a full-wavelength delta loop at 28.7 MHz. It would create an antenna with suboptimal electrical characteristics and reduced radiation efficiency."
  - text: "4.98 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is significantly shorter than required for a full-wavelength delta loop at 28.7 MHz. Such an antenna would have poor impedance matching, low radiation efficiency, and would not effectively radiate signals on the 10-meter band."

## The Concept: Delta Loop Antenna Fundamentals

A delta loop antenna is a triangular-shaped, full-wavelength wire antenna that offers excellent gain and omnidirectional radiation characteristics. Named for its triangular shape resembling the Greek letter Œî (delta), this antenna design is particularly popular among amateur radio operators for its simplicity and performance.

The fundamental principle of antenna design involves creating an antenna with a length closely matching the wavelength of the target frequency. For a full-wavelength loop, the total perimeter of the antenna should approximate one complete wavelength. This is calculated using the speed of light divided by the operating frequency, then adjusted for practical implementation.

### Wavelength Calculation Basics

To calculate the **approximate length** of a **delta loop antenna** for a given frequency like **28.7 MHz**, we follow these steps:

---

### üîß **Step 1: Determine the Wavelength**

The wavelength $\lambda$ in meters is given by:

$$
\lambda = \frac{300}{f}
$$

Where:

* $\lambda$ is the wavelength in meters
* $f$ is the frequency in MHz
* We use **300** as the speed of light approximation in MHz¬∑m

So for **28.7 MHz**:

$$
\lambda = \frac{300}{28.7} \approx 10.45 \text{ meters}
$$

---

### üîß **Step 2: Use the Loop Length Formula**

For a **full-wave loop antenna**, the total length $L$ is approximately equal to **one full wavelength**, but we often use a **correction factor** due to the geometry and real-world effects.

For a **delta loop**, a common formula is:

$$
L = 1.02 \times \lambda
$$

$$
L = 1.02 \times 10.45 \approx 10.66 \text{ meters}
$$

This gives the **total length of wire** needed for the delta loop.

---

### ‚úÖ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{10.66 \text{ meters (approx.)}}
$$

This is the **total perimeter** of the triangle-shaped (delta) loop. Each side would be roughly one-third of that if it's an equilateral triangle:

$$
\frac{10.66}{3} \approx 3.55 \text{ meters per side}
$$
