question: "Which resistor rating is specified as a given fraction per degree Celsius?"
answers:
  - text: "Temperature coefficient"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The temperature coefficient specifies how a resistor's electrical resistance changes with temperature, expressed as a percentage change per degree Celsius. This characteristic is critical for understanding how a resistor's performance might vary under different environmental conditions, particularly in precision electronic circuits where consistent resistance is essential."
  - text: "Tolerance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Tolerance indicates the maximum percentage deviation from a resistor's nominal resistance value at room temperature, not a per-degree Celsius change. It represents the manufacturing variation, typically expressed as ±1%, ±5%, or ±10%, but does not describe temperature-related resistance changes."
  - text: "Power rating"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power rating specifies the maximum amount of electrical power a resistor can dissipate without being damaged, typically measured in watts. It describes the resistor's heat-handling capability but does not represent a per-degree Celsius specification of resistance change."
  - text: "Ohmic value"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The ohmic value is the fixed resistance of a component at standard temperature, measured in ohms. While resistance can change with temperature, the base ohmic value is not specified as a fraction per degree Celsius."

## The Concept: Resistance and Temperature Interaction

Electrical resistance is not a perfectly stable characteristic. As temperature changes, the atomic structure of materials causes slight but important variations in electrical resistance. The **temperature coefficient** quantifies this change, expressing how much a resistor's resistance will shift for each degree of temperature variation.

Typically represented as parts per million per degree Celsius (ppm/°C), the temperature coefficient tells engineers precisely how predictable or variable a resistor's performance will be under different environmental conditions. Precision applications like scientific instrumentation, communications equipment, and measurement devices require extremely stable components with low temperature coefficients.

### Types of Temperature Coefficients

Different materials exhibit different temperature coefficient behaviors:
- **Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC)**: Resistance increases with temperature
- **Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC)**: Resistance decreases with temperature
- **Zero Temperature Coefficient**: Resistance remains nearly constant across temperature ranges
