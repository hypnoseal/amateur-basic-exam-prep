question: "A transformer with a 120-volt primary voltage supplies 250 watts to a transmitter. Neglecting losses, what is the approximate primary current?"
answers:
  - text: "2.1 amperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This answer is correct because it follows the fundamental power calculation formula: Power (W) = Voltage (V) × Current (A). By dividing 250 watts by 120 volts, we get approximately 2.083 amperes, which rounds to 2.1 amperes. This calculation assumes an ideal transformer with no losses, using the basic electrical power relationship."
  - text: "0.48 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value is too low for the given power and voltage. The calculation would result in a power output far less than the specified 250 watts. Specifically, 0.48 A × 120 V would only produce about 57.6 watts, which does not match the problem's parameters."
  - text: "1.4 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current is incorrect for the given power and voltage. If 1.4 A were flowing through a 120 V circuit, the power would be approximately 168 watts (1.4 A × 120 V), which is significantly less than the 250 watts specified in the problem."
  - text: "3.1 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value is too high for the given power and voltage. Multiplying 3.1 A by 120 V would produce 372 watts, which exceeds the specified 250 watts of power output from the transformer."

# Understanding Transformer Power and Current Calculations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How to calculate current in electrical circuits using power and voltage
- The relationship between power, voltage, and current
- Basic transformer electrical principles
- Practical applications of electrical calculations in amateur radio

## The Concept: Electrical Power Fundamentals

Electrical power is the product of voltage and current, represented by the fundamental equation: **P = V × I**
- P = Power (in watts, W)
- V = Voltage (in volts, V)
- I = Current (in amperes, A)

In transformer and circuit design, this relationship allows us to calculate any of these three values when two are known. For amateur radio operators, understanding these calculations is crucial for designing and maintaining station equipment, understanding power supplies, and ensuring safe operation.

### Transformer Basics

Transformers are critical components in amateur radio stations, used to step voltage up or down and provide electrical isolation. While real-world transformers have some losses, this problem assumes an ideal transformer to focus on the fundamental calculation.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Power Calculations:
- **250W at 120V**: 250 ÷ 120 = 2.083A (rounds to 2.1A)
- **500W at 120V**: 500 ÷ 120 = 4.167A
- **100W at 12V**: 100 ÷ 12 = 8.33A

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- Forgetting to divide power by voltage
- Neglecting to round appropriately
- Misinterpreting the units involved

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Stations:
1. **Power Supply Design**: Calculate current requirements for transceivers and amplifiers
2. **Antenna Tuner Power Handling**: Understand power distribution and current limitations
3. **Transmission Line Calculations**: Determine power loss and current at different points in the signal path

### For Test Preparation:
1. Always use P = V × I formula
2. Check units carefully
3. Round to the nearest tenth when required

### Memory Aid:
"**PIV** - **P**ower **I**s **V**oltage times Current"
