question: "On a resistor with four colour bands, what do the first three colour bands indicate?"
answers:
  - text: "The value of the resistor in ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The first three color bands on a four-band resistor represent the resistor's numerical value in ohms. The first two bands indicate the significant digits, while the third band serves as a multiplier to determine the complete resistance value. This standardized color coding system allows quick and accurate identification of a resistor's resistance without requiring specialized measuring equipment."
  - text: "The resistance material"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Resistor color bands do not indicate the material composition of the resistor. The material type would be determined through other manufacturing specifications, not by the color coding system used for value identification."
  - text: "The power rating in watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power rating is a separate specification typically printed separately on the resistor body, not represented by the color band coding system. The color bands are exclusively used to indicate the resistance value in ohms."
  - text: "The resistance tolerance in percent"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the fourth color band typically indicates tolerance, the first three bands are specifically used to represent the numerical resistance value. Tolerance is a separate piece of information conveyed by the fourth band."

## The Concept: Resistor Color Coding System

The resistor color coding system is a standardized method developed to provide a quick, visual way of identifying a resistor's electrical resistance value. Think of it like a secret language for electronic components, where each color represents a specific numerical digit or multiplier.

In a four-band resistor, the first two bands represent significant digits, while the third band acts as a multiplier that determines the final resistance value. This system allows technicians and engineers to instantly understand a resistor's characteristics without complex measurement tools.

### The Color-to-Number Mapping

Each color corresponds to a specific number:
- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Gray: 8
- White: 9

The third band tells you how many zeros to add after those first two digits, effectively acting as a multiplier.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Resistor Value Calculation Examples:
- **Red-Violet-Orange**: 27 × 1,000 = 27,000 Ω (27 kΩ)
- **Brown-Black-Red**: 10 × 100 = 1,000 Ω (1 kΩ)
- **Green-Blue-Yellow**: 56 × 10,000 = 560,000 Ω (560 kΩ)

### ❌ Common Misinterpretation Mistakes:
- Forgetting the multiplier effect of the third band
- Misreading colors due to poor lighting or color perception
- Confusing resistor color coding with other component marking systems
