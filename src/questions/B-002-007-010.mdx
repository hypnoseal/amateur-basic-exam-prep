question: "What is the Q code that means \"Who is calling me?\" in amateur radio?"
answers:
  - text: "QRZ?"
    correct: true
    explanation: "QRZ? is the internationally recognized Q-signal meaning \"Who is calling me?\" It is typically used on voice and CW modes when an operator wants to identify which station is attempting to make contact. This Q-code allows operators to request identification in a standardized, concise manner that transcends language barriers in international amateur radio communications."
  - text: "QRK?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QRK? means \"What is the readability of my signals?\" It is used to inquire about the clarity of a transmission, not to ask who is calling. This Q-code is about signal quality, not station identification."
  - text: "QRP?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QRP? refers to low power operations, typically meaning \"Shall I reduce power?\" or indicating a low-power transmission. It is not related to identifying who is calling and would be inappropriate in a situation where an operator wants to know the identity of a calling station."
  - text: "QRM?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QRM? means \"Are you experiencing interference?\" It is used to ask about external noise or signal disruption, not to identify who is calling. This Q-code relates to signal interference conditions, not station identification."

# Q-Codes in Amateur Radio: Understanding QRZ and Station Identification

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What Q-codes are and how they function in amateur radio communication
- The specific meaning and use of QRZ?
- How Q-codes help standardize international radio communication
- The importance of precise communication in amateur radio

## The Concept: Q-Codes and Their Role in Radio Communication

Q-codes are three-letter codes beginning with Q that provide standardized communication shortcuts for radio operators. Originally developed for maritime and military radio communications, these codes have been widely adopted by amateur radio operators worldwide to facilitate clear, concise communication across language barriers.

Each Q-code has a specific meaning that can be used as a question (when followed by a question mark) or as a statement. These codes allow operators to communicate complex ideas quickly and efficiently, especially in challenging communication environments or during contests and emergency communications.

### The International Language of Radio

Q-codes transcend national languages, creating a universal communication system. An operator from Canada can use QRZ? and be immediately understood by an amateur radio operator in Japan, Brazil, or Germany. This universality is a core strength of amateur radio's communication protocols.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Usage of QRZ?:
- **Calling Contest**: During a busy amateur radio contest when multiple stations are calling
- **Crowded Frequency**: When you hear a signal but can't distinguish the calling station's call sign
- **DX (Long Distance) Communication**: Asking which distant station is trying to make contact

### ❌ Incorrect QRZ? Applications:
- **Casual Conversation**: Using QRZ? when you can clearly hear who is calling
- **Written Communication**: Q-codes are primarily for radio communication, not written messages
- **Non-Radio Contexts**: Attempting to use QRZ? in everyday conversation

## Practical Applications

### For HF and VHF Operators:
1. **Listen First**: Always listen to a frequency before transmitting to understand ongoing communications
2. **Proper Response**: When someone sends QRZ?, respond with your full call sign
3. **Clarity**: Speak clearly and use phonetics when responding to a QRZ?

### For Different Operating Modes:
1. **CW (Morse Code)**: QRZ? is sent as "- --.- .-. --."
2. **SSB Voice**: Clearly pronounce "QRZ" as "Query Romeo Zulu"
3. **Digital Modes**: Include QRZ? in appropriate text formats

### Memory Aid:
"**Q**uickly **R**equest **Z**tation" - QRZ helps you quickly request who is calling!
