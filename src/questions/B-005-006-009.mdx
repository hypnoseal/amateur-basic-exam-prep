question: "What is the power consumption of two 10-ohm resistors connected in series with a 10-volt battery?"
answers:
  - text: "5 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two 10-ohm resistors are connected in series, they form a total resistance of 20 ohms. Using Ohm's Law (V = IR), the current through the circuit will be 0.5 amperes (10V ÷ 20Ω). Power is calculated by P = I²R or P = V²/R, which in this case is (0.5A)²(20Ω) = 5 watts. This demonstrates how series resistance affects current and power consumption in a simple electrical circuit."
  - text: "2 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the total series resistance or the correct power calculation. When resistors are connected in series, their resistance adds up, changing the total current and power consumption."
  - text: "20 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer significantly overestimates the power consumption. The total power is much lower due to the series connection increasing total resistance and reducing current flow through the circuit."
  - text: "0.5 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer underestimates the power consumption by not correctly calculating the total resistance and resulting current in the series circuit."

## The Concept: Series Circuits and Power Calculation

In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end, creating a single path for electrical current. When resistors are connected in series, their total resistance is the sum of individual resistances. In this case, two 10-ohm resistors create a total resistance of 20 ohms.

### Calculating Circuit Parameters

The key steps to solve this problem involve:
1. Calculating total resistance
2. Determining circuit current
3. Computing power consumption

Using Ohm's Law (V = IR), we can systematically work through the circuit's electrical characteristics:
- Voltage (V) = 10 volts
- Total Resistance (R) = 10Ω + 10Ω = 20 ohms
- Current (I) = V/R = 10V ÷ 20Ω = 0.5 amperes

Power calculation can be done using multiple formulas: P = VI, P = I²R, or P = V²/R. In this case, P = (0.5A)²(20Ω) = 5 watts.
