question: "If you wire two 24-microfarad capacitors in parallel, what is the capacity of the combination?"
answers:
  - text: "48 microfarads"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total capacitance is the sum of their individual capacitances. This means that connecting two 24-microfarad capacitors will result in a total capacitance of 48 microfarads. This is because in parallel connections, each capacitor contributes its full capacitance to the overall circuit, effectively increasing the total capacitance proportionally to the number of capacitors."
  - text: "12 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly suggests that capacitance is divided when capacitors are connected in parallel, which is not true. In parallel connections, capacitances add together, not divide. Connecting two 24-microfarad capacitors will result in 48 microfarads, not 12 microfarads."
  - text: "96 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly multiplies the capacitance values instead of adding them. When capacitors are connected in parallel, their capacitances are added, not multiplied. Two 24-microfarad capacitors will result in 48 microfarads, not 96 microfarads."
  - text: "4 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly suggests that capacitance is reduced when capacitors are connected in parallel. In reality, parallel connections increase total capacitance by adding the individual capacitances. Two 24-microfarad capacitors will result in 48 microfarads, not 4 microfarads."

## The Concept: Capacitors in Parallel

Capacitance is a measure of an electrical component's ability to store electrical charge. When capacitors are connected in parallel—meaning their positive terminals are connected together and their negative terminals are connected together—their total capacitance increases predictably and linearly.

The fundamental rule for parallel capacitors is simple: **Total Capacitance = Sum of Individual Capacitances**. Mathematically, this can be expressed as C_total = C1 + C2 + C3... For two capacitors, this means simply adding their individual capacitance values.

Think of capacitors in parallel like water reservoirs connected by pipes. Each reservoir (capacitor) contributes its full volume (capacitance) to the total system. When you connect them, the total storage capacity increases by the sum of their individual capacities.

### Why Capacitance Adds in Parallel

In a parallel connection, each capacitor experiences the same voltage. The total charge stored is the sum of charges from each individual capacitor. Since capacitance (C) is defined as charge (Q) divided by voltage (V), adding capacitors in parallel increases the total charge storage capacity while maintaining the same voltage.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Parallel Capacitor Configurations:
- **Power Supply Smoothing**: Multiple capacitors connected in parallel to increase total capacitance and improve voltage regulation
- **Audio Crossover Networks**: Using parallel capacitors to create specific frequency filtering characteristics
- **Electronic Filter Design**: Combining capacitors to achieve precise capacitance values not available in standard component ratings

### ❌ Incorrect Parallel Capacitor Assumptions:
- **Dividing Capacitance**: Believing capacitance reduces when capacitors are connected in parallel
- **Multiplying Capacitance**: Thinking capacitors' values multiply instead of add
- **Ignoring Individual Capacitor Ratings**: Assuming all capacitors in a parallel configuration must be identical
