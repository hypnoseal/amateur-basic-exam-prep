question: "What do we call the flow of electric charge in a circuit?"
answers:
  - text: "Current"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Current represents the movement of electric charge through a conductor, typically measured in amperes (A). It specifically describes the rate at which electrons flow through a circuit, providing a quantitative measure of charge transfer. In amateur radio and electronics, understanding current is crucial for designing and analyzing electrical and electronic systems."
  - text: "Voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit, measuring the 'pressure' that drives electric charge. While voltage provides the motivation for charge movement, it is not the movement itself. Voltage is measured in volts (V) and determines the potential for current to flow, but is not the flow of charge."
  - text: "Resistance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Resistance measures how much a material opposes the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Ω). It determines how easily current can move through a circuit, but resistance itself is not the flow of charge. In fact, resistance describes the obstacles to current flow, not the movement of charge itself."
  - text: "Capacitance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Capacitance is the ability of a component to store electrical charge, measured in farads (F). It describes a component's capacity to hold electric charge temporarily, but does not represent the actual movement of charge through a circuit. Capacitance is a storage property, not a flow characteristic."

## The Concept: Understanding Electric Current

Electric current is the directional flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons moving through a conductor. Think of current like water flowing through a pipe - it's the movement of charge from one point to another in an electrical circuit.

In most electrical systems, current flows from areas of higher electric potential to areas of lower potential. For amateur radio operators, understanding current is crucial for designing circuits, selecting components, and ensuring proper equipment operation.

### The Electron's Journey

At the atomic level, current occurs when electrons move through a conductive material. Metals like copper, which are used extensively in amateur radio equipment, have loosely bound electrons that can easily move when an electrical potential is applied.
