question: "What is the approximate length of the driven element of a quad antenna designed for 21.4 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "14.30 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct approximate length for a driven element in a quad antenna designed for the 21.4 MHz (15-meter) band. The calculation is based on the fundamental principle that an antenna's element length is directly related to the wavelength of the operating frequency. In this case, the full wavelength at 21.4 MHz is approximately 14.02 meters, and the driven element is typically designed to be about 1.02 wavelengths long, resulting in the 14.30-meter length."
  - text: "7.01 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is approximately half the correct driven element length for a quad antenna at 21.4 MHz. While half-wave lengths are important in antenna design, this specific measurement would result in a significantly underperforming antenna that would not effectively radiate or receive signals in the 15-meter band."
  - text: "10.93 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is too short for a full-sized driven element in a quad antenna designed for 21.4 MHz. It would result in poor antenna performance, reduced gain, and inefficient radiation of radio signals in the 15-meter band."
  - text: "3.57 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is far too short to be an effective driven element for a quad antenna at 21.4 MHz. Such a short element would create severe impedance mismatches and would be unable to efficiently radiate or receive signals in the 15-meter band."

## The Concept: Quad Antenna Fundamentals

A quad antenna is a type of wire antenna characterized by its square or rectangular loop design, typically used for high-frequency amateur radio bands. Unlike traditional Yagi antennas with straight elements, quad antennas use full-loop elements that form a complete geometric shape, often providing excellent gain and directivity.

The length of an antenna's driven element is critically dependent on the wavelength of the operating frequency. In amateur radio, this relationship is governed by fundamental electromagnetic principles where the antenna's physical dimensions are closely tied to the wavelength of the radio signals it's designed to transmit and receive.

### Wavelength and Frequency Relationship

For the 21.4 MHz frequency (15-meter band):
- Wavelength = Speed of Light ÷ Frequency
- Wavelength ≈ 300,000,000 m/s ÷ 21,400,000 Hz
- Wavelength ≈ 14.02 meters

The driven element of a quad antenna is typically designed to be slightly longer than a full wavelength, usually around 1.02 wavelengths to optimize performance.
