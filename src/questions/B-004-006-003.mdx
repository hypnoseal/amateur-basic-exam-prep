question: "On a resistor with four colour bands, what does the fourth colour band indicate?"
answers:
  - text: "The resistance tolerance in percent"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The fourth colour band represents the resistor's tolerance, which indicates how precisely the actual resistance value matches the nominal (stated) resistance value. Tolerance is expressed as a percentage and tells you the acceptable range of variation from the resistor's rated resistance. For example, a ±5% tolerance means the actual resistance can vary up to 5% above or below the marked value."
  - text: "The value of the resistor in ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The first three colour bands are used to determine the resistor's value in ohms, not the fourth band. The first two bands represent significant digits, while the third band is a multiplier. The fourth band specifically indicates tolerance, not the base resistance value."
  - text: "The power rating in watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power rating is determined by the resistor's physical size and construction, not by the colour bands. It indicates how much electrical power the resistor can dissipate as heat without being damaged. The colour bands are used for resistance value and tolerance, not power rating."
  - text: "The resistance material"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The material composition of the resistor is not indicated by the colour bands. These bands provide information about resistance value and tolerance. The resistor's material (such as carbon film, metal film, or wire-wound) is typically determined by other manufacturing specifications."

## The Concept: Resistance Tolerance and Colour Coding

Resistors are fundamental electronic components that limit current flow in electrical circuits. To help engineers and technicians quickly identify their characteristics, manufacturers use a standardized colour-coding system. On a four-band resistor, the first three bands indicate the resistance value, while the fourth band reveals the component's tolerance.

**Tolerance** represents the maximum percentage deviation from the resistor's nominal (stated) resistance value. This is crucial because no resistor is perfectly precise - there's always some variation in manufacturing. The tolerance band tells you how much the actual resistance can differ from the marked value.

### Understanding Tolerance Percentages

Common tolerance bands include:
- Gold: ±5%
- Silver: ±10%
- Brown: ±1%
- Red: ±2%
- Green: ±0.5%

A resistor marked as 1000 Ω with a ±5% tolerance could actually have a resistance between 950 Ω and 1050 Ω.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Tolerance Interpretation:
- **1 kΩ ±5% Resistor**: Actual resistance can range from 950 Ω to 1050 Ω
- **100 Ω ±1% Resistor**: Actual resistance can range from 99 Ω to 101 Ω
- **10 kΩ ±10% Resistor**: Actual resistance can range from 9 kΩ to 11 kΩ

### ❌ Misunderstandings About Colour Bands:
- **Thinking all bands represent value**: Only the first three bands determine resistance
- **Ignoring tolerance**: Assuming all resistors are exactly their marked value
- **Misinterpreting band positions**: Not understanding the standard colour sequence

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Design:
1. **Precision Circuits**: Low-tolerance resistors (1% or better) are crucial in precision analog circuits
2. **Signal Processing**: Matching resistors ensures consistent performance in audio and RF circuits
3. **Temperature Compensation**: Some applications require specific tolerance ranges

### For Amateur Radio Construction:
1. **Filter Design**: Precise resistor values critical for creating filters
2. **Antenna Matching Networks**: Tolerance affects impedance matching accuracy
3. **Test Equipment Calibration**: Low-tolerance resistors ensure measurement precision

### Memory Aid:
"**T**he **F**ourth **B**and **T**ells Tolerance" - Remember that fourth band means precision!
