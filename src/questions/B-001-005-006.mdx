question: "What regulatory requirement must be met to allow you to place an amateur radio transmitter in service on behalf of another person?"
answers:
  - text: "Both you and the other person must hold Amateur Radio Operator Certificates"
    correct: true
    explanation: "According to ISED regulations, when an amateur radio transmitter is being used on behalf of another person, both the operator and the station owner must hold valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificates. This requirement ensures that anyone operating or responsible for an amateur radio station understands the technical and regulatory obligations of amateur radio operation."
  - text: "Only the other person must hold an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because the operator actively using the transmitter must also have their own valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate. Simply having the station owner's certificate is insufficient for legal operation."
  - text: "Only you must hold an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because both the operator and the station owner must have valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificates. The regulations require certification for anyone operating or responsible for an amateur radio transmitter."
  - text: "The other person must be enrolled in an amateur radio certification course"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Course enrollment is not equivalent to holding a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate. Only a fully issued certificate from ISED meets the regulatory requirements for amateur radio station operation."

## The Concept: Amateur Radio Certification Requirements

Amateur radio is a licensed radio service where individual competence and accountability are paramount. Unlike many other communication services, amateur radio requires specific technical knowledge and operational skills demonstrated through official certification.

The fundamental principle is that **every person involved in the operation of an amateur radio station must be individually certified**. This means that simply owning a transmitter or having someone else's permission is not enough to legally operate an amateur radio station. Each individual must demonstrate their understanding of radio principles, operating procedures, and regulatory requirements by obtaining their own Amateur Radio Operator Certificate.

### Why Individual Certification Matters

These certification requirements serve multiple critical purposes:
- Ensure operators understand radio theory and technical principles
- Maintain the professional standards of the amateur radio service
- Prevent unauthorized or unqualified individuals from using radio spectrum
- Provide a framework for responsible spectrum management

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Scenarios Demonstrating Proper Certification:
- **Club Station**: Every member operating the club's shared radio must have their own valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate
- **Family Station**: If a parent and child both want to operate the home station, both must have individual certificates
- **Borrowed Equipment**: When using another amateur's radio, you must have your own valid certificate

### ❌ Non-Compliant Scenarios:
- **Uncertified Operation**: Using a transmitter without a personal certificate
- **Expired Certificate**: Operating with an out-of-date Amateur Radio Operator Certificate
- **Proxy Operation**: Letting an uncertified person operate under your supervision without direct involvement

## Practical Applications

### For Station Owners:
1. **Verify Operator Credentials**: Always confirm that anyone using your station has a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate
2. **Maintain Current Documentation**: Keep copies of certificates for reference
3. **Supervise New Operators**: Guide new amateurs through proper certification processes

### For Individual Operators:
1. **Personal Responsibility**: Always carry or have access to your valid certificate
2. **Continuous Learning**: Maintain and upgrade your certification as regulations evolve
3. **Ethical Operation**: Respect the requirement for individual certification

### Memory Aid:
"**C**ertificates for **A**ll, **T**ransmitters for **S**ome" (CATS) - Every operator needs a certificate, not every operator needs a transmitter.
