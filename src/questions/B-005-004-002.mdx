question: "How is the current in a DC circuit calculated when the voltage and resistance are known?"
answers:
  - text: "Current equals voltage divided by resistance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This describes Ohm's Law (I = V/R), the fundamental equation for calculating electrical current in a DC circuit. By dividing the voltage by the resistance, you determine the amount of current flowing through a circuit. This simple mathematical relationship explains how electrical pressure (voltage) pushes electrical flow (current) through a restricting element (resistance)."
  - text: "Current equals resistance multiplied by voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is mathematically incorrect and would produce a physically impossible result. Multiplying resistance and voltage would not yield current and would violate the fundamental principles of Ohm's Law. The correct relationship is current equals voltage divided by resistance."
  - text: "Current equals resistance divided by voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation is the inverse of Ohm's Law and would produce an incorrect and meaningless result. Dividing resistance by voltage does not represent how electrical current actually flows in a circuit and contradicts basic electrical principles."
  - text: "Current equals power divided by voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation mixes different electrical parameters incorrectly. Power is calculated by multiplying voltage and current (P = VI), so dividing power by voltage would not yield current. This approach fundamentally misunderstands the relationships between electrical quantities."

## The Concept: Electrical Flow and Ohm's Law

Electricity can be compared to water flowing through a pipe. **Voltage** is like water pressure, **current** is the volume of water flowing, and **resistance** is like the pipe's diameter. Ohm's Law describes how these three fundamental electrical properties interact in a direct current (DC) circuit.

The equation **I = V/R** (Current = Voltage ÷ Resistance) is the mathematical expression of how electrical current behaves. This means that the amount of current flowing through a circuit depends on two key factors: the electrical pressure (voltage) pushing it and the circuit's resistance to that flow.

### Why This Matters in Amateur Radio

Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for designing circuits, selecting components, and troubleshooting electrical systems in radio equipment. Whether you're building a power supply, designing an antenna matching network, or diagnosing a faulty circuit, Ohm's Law provides the fundamental mathematical framework for understanding electrical behavior.
