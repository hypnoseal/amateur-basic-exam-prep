question: "Two 1000-ohm resistors are connected in parallel across a 12-volt battery. What is the total current?"
answers:
  - text: "24 milliamperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two equal resistors are connected in parallel, the total current is calculated by first determining the equivalent resistance, then applying Ohm's Law. With two 1000-ohm resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is 500 ohms (1000/2). Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), the current becomes 12V ÷ 500Ω = 0.024A or 24 milliamperes. Each individual resistor will draw 12 milliamperes, totaling 24 milliamperes."
  - text: "12 milliamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would represent the current through a single resistor, not the total current. When resistors are connected in parallel, each resistor receives the full voltage, and the currents add together, resulting in a total current higher than the current through a single resistor."
  - text: "60 milliamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect value does not follow standard parallel resistance calculations. The total current would be less than 60 milliamperes given the specific resistance and voltage in this circuit."
  - text: "120 milliamperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is too high for the given circuit configuration. With two 1000-ohm resistors in parallel across 12 volts, the total current will be significantly less than 120 milliamperes."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance and Current Distribution

In a parallel circuit, each component (in this case, resistor) receives the full circuit voltage. Unlike series circuits where voltage is divided, parallel circuits allow each resistor to experience the same voltage while currents add together.

When two identical resistors are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is calculated by dividing the individual resistance by the number of resistors. This means two 1000-ohm resistors create an equivalent resistance of 500 ohms, which allows more current to flow compared to a single 1000-ohm resistor.

### Ohm's Law in Parallel Circuits

The fundamental equation governing electrical circuits is Ohm's Law: **V = I × R**
- V (Voltage) = 12 volts
- R (Equivalent Resistance) = 500 ohms
- I (Current) = V ÷ R = 12V ÷ 500Ω = 0.024A = 24 milliamperes
