question: "Before checking a fault in a mains-operated power supply unit, it would be safest to first:"
answers:
  - text: "turn off the power and unplug the power cord"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Turning off the power and unplugging the power cord completely eliminates the risk of electrical shock when examining an electronic device. This is the fundamental safety procedure for any electrical or electronic equipment maintenance, especially in power supply units that can hold dangerous levels of stored electrical charge even when the device appears to be off."
  - text: "short out the leads of the filter capacitor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Shorting capacitor leads is extremely dangerous and can cause sparks, potential equipment damage, or personal injury. Capacitors in power supplies can store significant electrical charge even after the power is disconnected, and attempting to short them without proper safety precautions can lead to dangerous electrical arcing or personal injury."
  - text: "check the action of the capacitor bleeder resistance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Attempting to check capacitor bleeder resistance before disconnecting power is unsafe. Bleeder resistors are designed to discharge capacitors, but they may not completely eliminate stored electrical charge, leaving potential shock hazards for the technician performing the inspection."
  - text: "remove and check the fuse from the power supply"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Removing a fuse while the device is still connected to mains power is extremely dangerous. The fuse itself does not provide protection from electrical shock, and manipulating it without first disconnecting power could expose the technician to potentially lethal electrical current."

# Electrical Safety in Amateur Radio: Power Supply Fault Checking Procedures

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The critical importance of electrical safety when working with electronic equipment
- Proper procedures for safely investigating electrical faults
- Potential hazards in power supply units
- Basic electrical safety principles for amateur radio operators

## The Concept: Electrical Safety in Electronic Equipment

Electrical safety is paramount when working with any electronic device, particularly power supply units that connect directly to mains electricity. Power supplies contain components that can store electrical charge even after the device is turned off, creating potential shock hazards for unsuspecting technicians.

The fundamental principle of electrical safety is simple: **eliminate all potential sources of electrical energy before beginning any inspection or repair**. This means completely disconnecting the device from its power source, which for mains-operated equipment means both turning off the power and physically unplugging the power cord.

### Why Unplugging is Critical

Electrical devices, especially power supplies, can retain electrical charge in capacitors long after they appear to be off. These stored charges can range from mild tingles to potentially fatal electrical shocks. Capacitors in power supplies can hold hundreds of volts, creating significant risk if not properly discharged and isolated.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Safe Electrical Inspection Procedures:
- **Complete Power Disconnection**: Unplug the device and wait several minutes for capacitors to discharge
- **Visual Inspection**: Check for obvious signs of damage or component failure
- **Use Proper Measurement Tools**: Use insulated test equipment with appropriate safety ratings

### ❌ Dangerous Electrical Practices:
- **Working on Energized Equipment**: Attempting to diagnose faults while the device is powered
- **Improper Capacitor Handling**: Touching or shorting capacitor leads without proper precautions
- **Ignoring Safety Equipment**: Working without insulated tools or appropriate personal protective equipment

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Equipment Maintenance:
1. **Always Unplug First**: Make unplugging the power cord your first action when investigating any electrical fault
2. **Wait and Discharge**: Allow several minutes for capacitors to naturally discharge after unplugging
3. **Use Proper Measurement Tools**: Invest in properly rated multimeters and test equipment

### For Power Supply Investigations:
1. **Visual Inspection**: Look for burned components, discoloration, or physical damage
2. **Systematic Testing**: Use methodical, safety-first approach to fault diagnosis
3. **Know Your Limits**: Be prepared to consult a professional if you're unsure about a repair
