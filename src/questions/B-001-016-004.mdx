question: "The maximum bandwidth of an amateur radio station's transmission allowed in the band 144 MHz to 148 MHz is:"
answers:
  - text: "30 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In the 2-meter band (144-148 MHz), the maximum authorized transmission bandwidth is 30 kHz. This bandwidth limit is established by ISED regulations to ensure efficient spectrum usage, minimize interference between stations, and allow multiple operators to share the limited frequency space. The 30 kHz limit accommodates most common amateur radio modes used in this band, including FM voice, packet radio, and some digital modes."
  - text: "6 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "6 kHz is too narrow for typical 2-meter band operations. While some narrow-band modes might fit within this bandwidth, most FM voice and digital communications require wider bandwidths. This bandwidth would significantly limit the types of communication possible on the 2-meter band and would not support standard repeater operations or most contemporary digital communication techniques."
  - text: "20 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "20 kHz is less than the authorized maximum bandwidth but still insufficient for most standard 2-meter band communications. This bandwidth would restrict the use of wider mode communications and would not provide the flexibility needed for typical amateur radio operations in the 144-148 MHz band."
  - text: "15 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "15 kHz is less than the maximum authorized bandwidth of 30 kHz. While closer to typical usage than some other options, this bandwidth would still impose unnecessary restrictions on 2-meter band communications, limiting the types of modes and data rates that could be employed."

## The Concept: Bandwidth in Amateur Radio

**Bandwidth** represents the range of frequencies occupied by a radio signal during transmission. Think of it like the width of a highway lane—the wider the lane, the more information can travel simultaneously. In amateur radio, bandwidth is carefully regulated to ensure efficient spectrum use and minimize interference between stations.

The 2-meter band (144-148 MHz) is a popular VHF allocation used for local communications, repeater systems, satellite communications, and experimental modes. The 30 kHz maximum bandwidth provides a balance between communication flexibility and spectrum efficiency, allowing modes from narrow-band digital communications to wider FM voice transmissions.

### Bandwidth and Communication Modes

Different amateur radio modes require different bandwidths:
- **FM Voice**: Typically 16-20 kHz
- **SSB Voice**: Around 3 kHz
- **Digital Modes**: Varies from 500 Hz to 30 kHz
- **Packet Radio**: Often 9600 baud requires about 20 kHz

The 30 kHz limit ensures operators can choose from a wide range of communication techniques without causing excessive interference.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Bandwidth-Compliant Transmissions:
- **FM Repeater Voice**: 16 kHz bandwidth within 30 kHz limit
- **Digital Voice Modes**: DMR, C4FM typically 12-20 kHz
- **Packet Radio**: 9600 baud packet at approximately 20 kHz

### ❌ Non-Compliant Transmissions:
- **Extremely Wide Modes**: Signals exceeding 30 kHz
- **Improperly Configured Digital Modes**: Transmissions that bleed outside allocated bandwidth
- **Misconfigured Transmitters**: Equipment not properly adjusted to limit bandwidth

## Practical Applications

### For 2-Meter Band Users:
1. **Repeater Operations**: Ensure your transmission fits within 30 kHz
2. **Digital Mode Selection**: Choose modes compatible with bandwidth limits
3. **Equipment Configuration**: Verify transmitter bandwidth settings

### For Different Communication Scenarios:
1. **Local Nets**: Maintain consistent, bandwidth-efficient communications
2. **Emergency Communications**: Maximize information transfer within spectral constraints
3. **Experimental Modes**: Innovate within established technical boundaries

### Memory Aid:
"**T**hink **H**ighway **I**n **R**adio **T**ransmission" (THIRT) - bandwidth is like a highway lane width for radio signals
