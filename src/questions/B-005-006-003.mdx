question: "What is the DC input power of a transmitter operating at 12 volts and drawing 500 milliamperes?"
answers:
  - text: "6 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The DC input power is calculated by multiplying voltage by current (P = V × I). In this case, 12 volts × 0.5 amperes (500 milliamperes) = 6 watts. This calculation represents the electrical power consumed by the transmitter before any efficiency losses are considered."
  - text: "24 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer likely comes from misinterpreting the current value or miscalculating the power equation. 24 watts would result from multiplying 12 volts by 2 amperes, which is not the given current in the problem."
  - text: "60 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is incorrect and would require a much higher current draw (60 watts ÷ 12 volts = 5 amperes). The actual current in the problem is only 0.5 amperes, resulting in a much lower power calculation."
  - text: "600 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This extremely high power value is far beyond the current and voltage specified in the problem. It would require an unrealistic current draw of 50 amperes at 12 volts, which is not the case in this scenario."

# Understanding DC Power Calculation in Amateur Radio Transmitters

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How to calculate DC input power using voltage and current
- The relationship between volts, amperes, and watts
- Basic electrical power calculations for amateur radio equipment
- The importance of understanding power consumption in radio communications

## The Concept: Electrical Power and Ohm's Law

Electrical power is the product of voltage and current, expressed by the fundamental equation **P = V × I**, where:
- **P** represents Power (in watts)
- **V** represents Voltage (in volts)
- **I** represents Current (in amperes)

In amateur radio, understanding power calculations is crucial for equipment selection, battery planning, and understanding transmitter performance. The conversion of electrical power involves simple mathematical relationships that help operators make informed decisions about their radio equipment.

### Unit Conversion Considerations

When solving power problems, pay careful attention to units:
- Milliamperes (mA) must be converted to amperes (A) by dividing by 1000
- 500 milliamperes = 0.5 amperes
- Volts remain as they are
- The result will be in watts

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Power Calculations:
- **12V × 0.5A = 6W**: The exact scenario in this exam question
- **13.8V × 1A = 13.8W**: Typical power consumption for a mobile HF transceiver
- **5V × 2A = 10W**: Typical power for a small digital mode interface

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Forgetting unit conversions**: Leaving milliamperes as-is instead of converting to amperes
- **Misreading decimal points**: Confusing 0.5A with 5A
- **Mixing up voltage and current values**
