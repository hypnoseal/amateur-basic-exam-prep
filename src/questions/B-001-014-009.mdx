question: "While operating in Canada, what information must the holder of a United States-issued call sign indicate at least once during a contact?"
answers:
  - text: "Location by city and province"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When operating in Canada with a foreign-issued call sign, operators must indicate their location by city and province. This requirement ensures clear identification and helps maintain accurate location information for regulatory compliance. Canadian regulations require visiting amateur radio operators to clearly communicate their geographic location to local operators and potential emergency coordinators."
  - text: "Current grid square"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While grid squares can be useful for weak signal communications or contests, they are not the required location identification for foreign operators in Canada. Grid squares are optional information and do not satisfy the regulatory requirement for location identification during a contact."
  - text: "Location and output power"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Output power is not a mandatory identification requirement for foreign operators in Canada. While power levels are important for technical compliance, they do not replace the need to specify the city and province of operation as required by Canadian amateur radio regulations."
  - text: "City and state of residence"
    correct: false
    explanation: "City and state of residence from the operator's home country is not sufficient for Canadian amateur radio contacts. Canadian regulations specifically require foreign operators to identify their location within Canada using the city and province where they are currently operating."

## The Concept: Location Reporting for Foreign Amateur Radio Operators

Amateur radio is a global community with carefully managed international agreements that allow licensed operators to operate in countries other than their home nation. In Canada, foreign operators—including those with United States-issued call signs—must follow specific identification protocols that go beyond simply using their assigned call sign.

The primary requirement is to clearly communicate your location within Canada by specifying the city and province where you are currently operating. This requirement serves multiple important purposes:
- Provides local operators with context about your geographic position
- Assists in emergency communication coordination
- Ensures transparency and accountability in amateur radio operations
- Helps local amateur radio communities track and welcome visiting operators

### Why City and Province Matter

Unlike some countries where state or region identification might be optional, Canadian regulations emphasize precise local identification. This reflects Canada's vast geographic landscape and the importance of accurate location information in emergency preparedness and community communication.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Foreign Operator Identification:
- **"VA7XXX, operating in Vancouver, British Columbia"**: Precise, compliant location identification
- **"W1ABC in Calgary, Alberta"**: Clear statement of city and province for a US-licensed operator
- **"K3DEF mobile in Toronto, Ontario"**: Includes location even during mobile operations

### ❌ Incorrect or Insufficient Identification:
- **"W2XYZ from the United States"**: Lacks specific Canadian location
- **"K4ABC grid square CN87"**: Provides grid square but not required city/province
- **"W5DEF from my home state"**: References home location, not current Canadian location

## Practical Applications

### For Visiting Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Memorize Your Location**: Always know the city and province where you're operating
2. **Include Location Consistently**: Mention city and province at least once during each contact
3. **Use Standard Phonetic Identification**: Clearly spell out city and province names

### For Local Canadian Operators:
1. **Welcome Visiting Operators**: Help foreign operators understand local identification requirements
2. **Assist with Proper Reporting**: Remind visitors to specify their current Canadian location
3. **Maintain Regulatory Compliance**: Encourage accurate and complete station identification
