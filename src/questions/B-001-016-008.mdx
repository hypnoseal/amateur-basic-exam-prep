question: "What precaution must an amateur radio operator take when transmitting near band edges?"
answers:
  - text: "Ensure that the entire occupied bandwidth falls within the amateur radio band"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This precaution prevents the signal from inadvertently extending beyond the allocated amateur radio band, which could cause interference to adjacent services or violate ISED frequency allocation regulations. By keeping the entire occupied bandwidth within the designated band limits, amateur radio operators maintain spectral discipline and minimize the risk of causing harmful interference to other radio services."
  - text: "Restrict operation to radiotelegraphy (CW) or digital modes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While CW and digital modes typically have narrower bandwidths, this is not a universal requirement for avoiding band edge issues. Modern communication modes like SSB, FM, and various digital protocols can be used near band edges if proper care is taken to manage bandwidth and prevent signal spillover."
  - text: "Make sure that the emission mode is compatible with agreed band plans"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While band plans are important for coordinating amateur radio operations, they are not the primary mechanism for preventing out-of-band emissions. Emission mode compatibility is a consideration, but the fundamental requirement is ensuring the entire signal remains within the allocated band limits."
  - text: "Reduce transmitter power"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Reducing transmitter power does not inherently prevent out-of-band emissions. The key concern is the signal's occupied bandwidth, which is determined by the modulation method and bandwidth, not necessarily by transmission power."

- The importance of preventing interference to adjacent radio services

## The Concept: Occupied Bandwidth and Band Edge Management

In amateur radio, **occupied bandwidth** represents the frequency range actually used by a transmitted signal, including its primary frequency and adjacent sidebands. Unlike the common misconception that a radio signal is a single, precise frequency, most transmission modes spread energy across a range of frequencies.

Different communication modes have varying bandwidth characteristics:
- **CW (Continuous Wave)**: Extremely narrow, typically less than 500 Hz
- **SSB (Single Sideband)**: Around 2.7 kHz wide
- **FM Voice**: Approximately 16 kHz wide
- **Digital Modes**: Can range from 500 Hz to several kHz depending on the specific protocol

The critical requirement is ensuring that 100% of this occupied bandwidth remains within the allocated amateur radio band, preventing any signal energy from "spilling over" into adjacent frequency allocations.

### Regulatory and Practical Implications

Amateur radio bands are precisely defined, often with strict boundaries shared with other radio services like broadcast, maritime, or government communications. Allowing your signal to extend beyond these boundaries can:
- Cause harmful interference to other radio services
- Violate ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) regulations
- Risk potential license suspension or revocation
- Potentially disrupt critical communications in adjacent services

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Band Edge Management:
- **SSB Operator**: Carefully adjusting audio processing to ensure sidebands remain within 20-meter band limits
- **Digital Mode User**: Selecting narrow-bandwidth modes when operating near band edges
- **Contest Operator**: Using precision filtering to prevent out-of-band emissions during high-activity periods

### ❌ Improper Band Edge Handling:
- **Unfiltered Transmission**: Allowing signal sidebands to leak into adjacent broadcast or maritime frequencies
- **Misconfigured Digital Mode**: Using unnecessarily wide bandwidth settings near band boundaries
- **Poorly Aligned Transceiver**: Operating without proper filter alignment, causing spectral "splatter"

## Practical Applications

### For HF and VHF Operators:
1. **Use Narrow Filtering**: Employ tight receiver and transmitter filters near band edges
2. **Monitor Bandwidth**: Use spectrum analyzer or computer-based tools to visualize your signal's true occupied bandwidth
3. **Understand Your Mode**: Learn the typical bandwidth requirements for different communication methods

### Technical Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Audio Compression**: Carefully manage microphone gain and compression to minimize unnecessary bandwidth
2. **Digital Mode Configuration**: Select appropriate bandwidth settings for your chosen protocol
3. **Transceiver Alignment**: Ensure transmitter is properly aligned and filtered
