question: "Your neighbour complains that your transmissions interfere with their garage door opener. When determining the applicable field strength criterion in Electromagnetic Compatibility Advisory Bulletin EMCAB-2, what type of equipment is the garage door opener?"
answers:
  - text: "Radio-sensitive equipment"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In the context of Electromagnetic Compatibility Advisory Bulletin EMCAB-2, a garage door opener is classified as radio-sensitive equipment because it relies on radio frequency signals for operation and can be easily disrupted by external radio frequency emissions. This classification means it is particularly vulnerable to interference from other radio transmissions, such as those from amateur radio stations."
  - text: "Associated equipment"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Associated equipment typically refers to supplementary devices directly connected to or part of a primary system. A garage door opener operates independently and is not considered associated equipment in electromagnetic compatibility terminology."
  - text: "Broadcast equipment"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Broadcast equipment relates to radio and television transmission systems, which is not applicable to a personal garage door opener. This classification is used for professional broadcasting infrastructure, not consumer electronic devices."
  - text: "Low-immunity equipment"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While a garage door opener might seem like low-immunity equipment, the specific technical classification in EMCAB-2 for this type of device is radio-sensitive equipment, not low-immunity equipment."

## The Concept: Radio-Sensitive Equipment and Electromagnetic Compatibility

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is a critical technical discipline that ensures electronic devices can coexist without interfering with each other's operation. Different types of electronic equipment have varying levels of susceptibility to radio frequency emissions, and these are carefully categorized to help manage potential interference.

**Radio-sensitive equipment** refers to devices that are particularly vulnerable to radio frequency signals. These are electronic systems that can experience disruption or malfunction when exposed to electromagnetic emissions from other sources. Garage door openers are a perfect example of such equipment because they typically use low-power radio frequency signals for their control mechanism and can be easily upset by stronger nearby transmissions.

### How Garage Door Openers Work

Most modern garage door openers use radio frequency remote controls operating in the 300-400 MHz range. These systems are designed with relatively simple receiver circuits that can be easily overwhelmed by stronger nearby radio signals. When an amateur radio operator transmits on a nearby frequency with significant power, the garage door opener's receiver might misinterpret these signals as control commands or simply fail to distinguish between desired and undesired radio emissions.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Characteristics of Radio-Sensitive Equipment:
- **Garage Door Openers**: Easily disrupted by nearby radio transmissions
- **Wireless Doorbells**: Can trigger false signals from nearby radio sources
- **Cordless Telephones**: Susceptible to interference from various radio emissions

### ❌ Equipment Less Vulnerable to Radio Interference:
- **Wired Telecommunications Systems**: Use physical connections less susceptible to radio interference
- **Fiber Optic Communication Systems**: Immune to electromagnetic emissions
- **Hardwired Electronic Controls**: Not reliant on radio frequency signals for operation

2. **Proper Transmission Practices**: Use appropriate power levels and filtering
3. **Cooperative Problem Solving**: Work with neighbors to minimize unintended interference

### For Understanding Electromagnetic Compatibility:
1. **Signal Strength Considerations**: Recognize how transmission power affects nearby electronics
2. **Frequency Selection**: Choose transmission frequencies with minimal potential for interference
3. **Mitigation Techniques**: Implement low-pass filters and proper grounding to reduce unwanted emissions

### Memory Aid:
