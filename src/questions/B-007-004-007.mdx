question: "On the VHF and UHF bands, the polarization of the receiving antenna in relation to the transmitting antenna is very important, yet on HF bands it is relatively unimportant. Why is that so?"
answers:
  - text: "The refraction in the ionosphere changes the wave's polarization"
    correct: true
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is correct.]"
  - text: "The polarization of ground waves and ionospheric waves continually varies"
    correct: false
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is incorrect.]"
  - text: "The refraction forces the wave's polarization to vertical"
    correct: false
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is incorrect.]"
  - text: "The polarization of ionospheric waves varies depending on the entry angle into the refracting region"
    correct: false
