question: "If two equal-value inductors are connected in parallel, what is their total inductance?"
answers:
  - text: "Half the value of one inductor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When equal-value inductors are connected in parallel, their total inductance is reduced to half the value of a single inductor. This follows the parallel combination formula for inductors, which is similar to the formula for parallel resistors. The reduction occurs because parallel inductors provide multiple paths for magnetic flux, effectively decreasing the overall inductance of the circuit."
  - text: "Twice the value of one inductor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. In a parallel configuration, the total inductance is always less than the value of a single inductor, not doubled. Parallel inductors create multiple magnetic paths that reduce the overall inductance, not increase it."
  - text: "The value of one inductor times 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation is completely incorrect. Parallel inductors do not multiply their individual values. In fact, parallel inductors reduce the total inductance, not multiply it."
  - text: "The value of one inductor divided by 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While parallel inductors do reduce total inductance, the reduction is to half the value of a single inductor, not one-fourth. This answer incorrectly suggests a more extreme reduction than actually occurs."

## The Concept: Parallel Inductor Behavior

Inductors in parallel create multiple magnetic flux paths, which reduces the overall inductance of the circuit. When two identical inductors are connected in parallel, their total inductance follows a specific mathematical relationship that results in half the value of a single inductor.

The physical principle behind this reduction involves magnetic field interactions. Each inductor provides an alternative path for magnetic flux, effectively "sharing" the total magnetic coupling. This shared pathway reduces the circuit's ability to store magnetic energy, thus lowering the total inductance.

### The Mathematical Model

For two equal inductors L1 and L2 connected in parallel, the total inductance (Lt) is calculated using the formula:

1/Lt = 1/L1 + 1/L2

When L1 = L2, this simplifies to:
Lt = L/2 (where L is the value of a single inductor)
