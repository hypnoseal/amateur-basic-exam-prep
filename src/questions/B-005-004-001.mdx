question: "What is the voltage across a 2-ohm resistor if a current of 0.5 amperes flows through it?"
answers:
  - text: "1.0 volts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), voltage is calculated by multiplying current (0.5 A) by resistance (2 Ω), which results in 1.0 volts. This straightforward calculation demonstrates the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits."
  - text: "0.25 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer would result from dividing current by resistance (0.5 A ÷ 2 Ω) instead of multiplying, which reverses the Ohm's Law calculation and produces an incorrect result."
  - text: "2.5 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is incorrect and would require a different combination of current and resistance. It suggests a miscalculation or misunderstanding of Ohm's Law voltage calculation."
  - text: "1.5 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer shows a common mistake of adding or slightly modifying the correct calculation, demonstrating the importance of precise mathematical calculations in electrical theory."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law Fundamentals

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical theory that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). Represented by the equation V = I × R, this law allows us to calculate any of these three electrical properties when the other two are known.

In electrical systems, you can think of this relationship like water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is the pressure pushing the current (water flow), resistance is like the pipe's narrowness restricting that flow, and current is the actual amount of electricity moving through the circuit. The beauty of Ohm's Law is its simplicity and universal applicability across electrical and electronic systems.

### Mathematical Breakdown
- **V (Voltage)** is measured in volts (V)
- **I (Current)** is measured in amperes (A)
- **R (Resistance)** is measured in ohms (Ω)
- The equation V = I × R allows you to calculate any value when you know the other two

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Ohm's Law Applications:
- **2 Ω resistor with 0.5 A current**: Voltage = 0.5 A × 2 Ω = 1.0 V
- **10 Ω resistor with 3 A current**: Voltage = 3 A × 10 Ω = 30 V
- **5 Ω resistor with 0.2 A current**: Voltage = 0.2 A × 5 Ω = 1.0 V

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Dividing instead of multiplying**: 0.5 A ÷ 2 Ω = 0.25 V (incorrect)
- **Adding resistance and current**: 0.5 A + 2 Ω ≠ Voltage
- **Ignoring units**: Always keep track of volts, amperes, and ohms
