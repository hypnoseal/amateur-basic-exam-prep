question: "A battery, that can be repeatedly recharged by supplying it with electrical energy, is known as a:"
answers:
  - text: "storage battery"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A storage battery is a rechargeable battery that can convert electrical energy back into chemical energy during charging, allowing it to be used multiple times. This type of battery can restore its original chemical composition through the application of an external electrical current, making it fundamentally different from single-use primary batteries. Common examples include lead-acid car batteries, lithium-ion batteries used in electronics, and sealed gel cell batteries used in amateur radio equipment."
  - text: "low leakage battery"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Low leakage refers to a battery's ability to maintain its charge over time without significant self-discharge, which is a characteristic of battery performance, not its rechargeability. This term describes a battery's storage efficiency, but does not indicate whether the battery can be recharged by applying electrical energy."
  - text: "memory battery"
    correct: false
    explanation: "'Memory battery' is not a standard technical term in battery technology. This term might be confused with the 'memory effect' experienced by some older rechargeable battery types like nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, where incomplete discharge before recharging could reduce the battery's effective capacity. However, it is not a correct term for describing a rechargeable battery."
  - text: "primary battery"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A primary battery is a single-use battery designed to be discharged only once and then discarded. Unlike storage batteries, primary batteries cannot be recharged and will be permanently depleted after their initial use. Examples include standard alkaline batteries and zinc-carbon batteries commonly used in small electronic devices."

## The Concept: Storage Batteries and Electrical Energy Conversion

A storage battery, also known as a secondary battery, is an electrochemical device capable of converting electrical energy into chemical energy during charging and then back into electrical energy during discharge. This unique ability allows the battery to be reused multiple times, making it fundamentally different from single-use primary batteries.

The core principle of a storage battery involves reversible chemical reactions. During charging, electrical energy forces the battery's chemical components back into their original, high-energy state. When discharged, these components return to their lower-energy configuration, releasing electrical energy in the process.

### Battery Chemistry Basics

Different storage battery technologies use various chemical systems:
- Lead-acid batteries (used in cars and some amateur radio backup systems)
- Lithium-ion batteries (common in portable electronics)
- Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries
- Sealed gel cell batteries

Each type has unique characteristics in terms of energy density, charge/discharge cycles, and performance under different conditions.
