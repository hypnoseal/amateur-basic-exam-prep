question: "In a parallel-resonant circuit at resonance, the circuit has:"
answers:
  - text: "high impedance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "At resonance, a parallel LC circuit develops extremely high impedance because the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other perfectly. This creates a condition where the circuit presents maximum opposition to current flow at the resonant frequency, resulting in very high circuit impedance."
  - text: "low impedance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Low impedance is characteristic of a series-resonant circuit, not a parallel-resonant circuit. In a parallel configuration, the circuit actually exhibits high impedance at the resonant frequency, not low impedance."
  - text: "low mutual inductance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Mutual inductance describes the interaction between separate inductors, which is not the primary characteristic defining a parallel-resonant circuit's behavior at resonance. The answer incorrectly introduces an unrelated concept that doesn't describe the circuit's impedance characteristics."
  - text: "high mutual inductance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "High mutual inductance relates to coupling between separate inductors and is not a defining characteristic of a parallel-resonant circuit's behavior at its resonant frequency. This answer misunderstands the fundamental electrical properties of parallel-resonant circuits."

## The Concept: Parallel-Resonant Circuit Behavior

A parallel-resonant circuit consists of an inductor and capacitor connected in parallel, creating a complex electrical system with unique frequency-dependent characteristics. At the precise moment when the circuit reaches its **resonant frequency**, something fascinating happens: the circuit develops extremely high impedance.

This occurs because at resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances become exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in phase. In a parallel configuration, this means the reactive components create a condition of maximum circuit opposition to current flow. Imagine two equally strong wrestlers perfectly canceling each other's movements - that's essentially what's happening electrically inside the circuit.

### The Physics of Resonance

When an LC circuit reaches its resonant frequency (calculated by the formula f = 1 / (2π√(LC))), the following key behaviors emerge:
- Inductive reactance (XL) exactly equals capacitive reactance (XC)
- Reactive currents in the inductor and capacitor cancel each other
- The circuit presents maximum impedance to external current sources
- Minimal energy is dissipated in the circuit

### Circuit Design Considerations:
1. **Precise Frequency Selection**: Choose component values to target specific resonant frequencies
2. **Minimize Signal Loss**: Leverage high-impedance characteristics for efficient signal handling
3. **Understand Bandwidth**: Recognize how circuit Q-factor affects resonance sharpness

### Memory Aid:
"**H**igh **I**mpedance **R**equires **E**qual (HIRE)" - At resonance, parallel circuits have High Impedance when Reactances are Equal.
