question: "Amateur radio operations are NOT protected from interference caused by another service operating in which of the following frequency bands?"
answers:
  - text: "902 MHz to 928 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The 902-928 MHz band is a shared allocation where amateur radio does not have primary status and must accept interference from other services, particularly industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment. Unlike other amateur radio bands where interference protection is guaranteed, this band requires amateur operators to be prepared for potential disruptions from licensed and unlicensed devices."
  - text: "144 MHz to 148 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 2-meter band (144-148 MHz) is a primary amateur radio allocation where amateur services are protected from harmful interference from other services. This band has well-established international amateur radio allocations with defined protection rights."
  - text: "222 MHz to 225 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 222-225 MHz band is a designated amateur radio allocation in North America with established interference protection. Amateur radio has primary status in this frequency range and is protected from harmful interference from other services."
  - text: "50 MHz to 54 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 6-meter band (50-54 MHz) is a recognized amateur radio allocation with established interference protection rights. Amateur radio operators are protected from harmful interference in this frequency range."

# Interference Protection in Amateur Radio Frequency Allocations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How frequency allocations determine interference protection
- The unique status of the 902-928 MHz band for amateur radio
- The principles of primary and secondary spectrum usage
- The importance of frequency coordination in radio services

## The Concept: Spectrum Allocation and Interference Rights

Radio frequency spectrum is a carefully managed shared resource where different services are allocated specific bands with varying levels of protection. In amateur radio, not all frequency bands offer the same interference protection, creating a complex landscape of spectrum usage rights.

Frequency allocations are determined by national and international regulatory bodies like Industry Canada (ISED) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These organizations assign different status levels to various radio services within specific frequency ranges, defining whether a service has primary or secondary allocation status.

### Primary vs. Secondary Allocations

- **Primary Allocation**: The service has full interference protection and priority use of the frequency band
- **Secondary Allocation**: The service must accept interference from primary users and cannot cause harmful interference to primary services
- **Shared Allocation**: Multiple services can use the band, with specific rules governing coexistence

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Amateur Radio Bands with Full Interference Protection:
- **144-148 MHz (2-meter band)**: Full amateur radio primary allocation
- **50-54 MHz (6-meter band)**: Primary amateur radio allocation in North America
- **222-225 MHz**: Dedicated amateur radio band with protection rights

### ❌ Bands with Limited or No Interference Protection:
- **902-928 MHz**: Shared with industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment
- **Certain microwave bands**: Shared with satellite and terrestrial services
- **Bands near critical infrastructure frequencies**: Potential limited protection

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Frequency Awareness**: Always know your band's allocation status before transmitting
2. **Interference Management**: Be prepared to adapt operations in shared spectrum
3. **Equipment Selection**: Choose radios and antennas compatible with specific band characteristics

### For 902-928 MHz Specifically:
1. **Expect Potential Disruptions**: ISM equipment can cause significant interference
2. **Use Robust Communication Modes**: Consider digital modes that handle interference well
3. **Implement Advanced Receiver Techniques**: Use noise blanking and digital signal processing

### Memory Aid:
"**N**o **P**rotection **N**ear **9**00" - The 902-928 MHz band lacks interference protection.
