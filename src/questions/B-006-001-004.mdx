question: "Why can coaxial cables of different diameters have the same characteristic impedance?"
answers:
  - text: "Their characteristic impedance depends on the ratio of conductor diameters"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The characteristic impedance of a coaxial cable is determined by the geometric relationship between the inner and outer conductor diameters, not their absolute sizes. By maintaining a specific proportional ratio between the center conductor and shield, different sized cables can achieve identical impedance characteristics. This means a thick 50-ohm cable and a thinner 50-ohm cable can have the same electrical properties if their diameter ratio remains consistent."
  - text: "Characteristic impedance is independent of line diameter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is incorrect. Cable diameter directly influences characteristic impedance through its impact on the electric and magnetic fields surrounding the conductors. Changes in diameter affect the capacitance and inductance per unit length, which are fundamental to determining the cable's impedance."
  - text: "Characteristic impedance is set by the choice of conducting material"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While conductor material affects signal transmission properties like attenuation, the characteristic impedance is primarily determined by the geometric configuration of the conductors, specifically their relative diameters and the dielectric material between them, not the material composition."
  - text: "Their characteristic impedance depends on operating frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "For ideal transmission lines, characteristic impedance is primarily a function of physical geometry and remains relatively constant across frequencies. While very high frequencies can introduce slight variations, the fundamental impedance is established by the conductor dimensions and dielectric properties."

## The Concept: Transmission Line Impedance Fundamentals

Characteristic impedance is a fundamental property of transmission lines that describes how electrical signals propagate along a cable. It's not simply about the size of the conductors, but about their precise geometric relationship—specifically the ratio between the inner and outer conductor diameters.

Imagine characteristic impedance like the proportions of a musical instrument. A flute and a trumpet might be different sizes, but their internal proportions determine their unique sound. Similarly, coaxial cables can vary in size while maintaining identical electrical characteristics if their internal geometry remains consistent.

### The Mathematical Foundation

The characteristic impedance (Z₀) of a coaxial cable is calculated using a formula that depends on:
- Diameter of the inner conductor
- Diameter of the outer conductor (shield)
- Dielectric constant of the insulating material between conductors

The key insight is that it's the **ratio** of these diameters, not their absolute sizes, that determines the impedance.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Consistent Impedance Through Proportional Design:
- **Thin 50Ω Cable**: Inner conductor 0.5mm, shield 2.5mm diameter
- **Thick 50Ω Cable**: Inner conductor 1mm, shield 5mm diameter
- **Both Cables**: Maintain a 1:5 conductor-to-shield diameter ratio, resulting in identical 50Ω impedance

### ❌ Impedance Variation Scenarios:
- **Mismatched Ratios**: Changing the inner/outer conductor ratio will alter impedance
- **Non-Uniform Dielectrics**: Inconsistent insulation can disrupt impedance characteristics
- **Manufacturing Variations**: Precise geometric control is crucial for consistent performance

### For Different Radio Frequency Applications:
1. **VHF/UHF**: Precise impedance critical for minimizing signal reflection
2. **HF Long-Distance**: Impedance consistency helps maintain signal integrity
3. **Connector Compatibility**: Matching impedance ensures seamless interconnection of different cable segments
