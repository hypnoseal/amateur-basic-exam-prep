question: "If the voltage applied to two resistors in series is doubled, how much will the total power change?"
answers:
  - text: "Increase four times"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When voltage is doubled across a series circuit, the current remains constant (due to series resistance), but power increases quadratically. Since power is calculated by P = V²/R, doubling voltage will cause the power to increase by a factor of 4 (2² = 4). This follows the fundamental relationship between voltage, resistance, and power in electrical circuits."
  - text: "Decrease to half"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because increasing voltage will actually increase power, not decrease it. The power relationship is quadratic, not linear, so a voltage change has a more dramatic effect than a simple linear reduction."
  - text: "Double"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the answer might seem intuitive, power doesn't simply double when voltage doubles. Because power is proportional to voltage squared, the increase is more dramatic, resulting in a four-fold power increase in a series circuit."
  - text: "Decrease to one quarter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is the opposite of what actually occurs. Increasing voltage will cause power to increase, not decrease. In a series circuit with constant resistance, doubling voltage will cause power to increase by a factor of 4, not reduce to one-quarter."

## The Concept: Power Calculation and Circuit Behavior

Power in electrical circuits is not a linear phenomenon but a quadratic relationship governed by the fundamental equation P = V²/R. This means that changes in voltage have a more dramatic effect on power than might be intuitively expected.

In a series circuit, where total resistance remains constant, voltage changes produce predictable power transformations. The key principle is that power is proportional to the square of the voltage. When you double voltage, you're effectively squaring a factor of 2, which results in a four-fold power increase.

### The Mathematical Foundation

Consider the power equation: P = V²/R
- If V increases from V to 2V
- P will change from V²/R to (2V)²/R
- This becomes 4V²/R
- The result is a four-times increase in power
