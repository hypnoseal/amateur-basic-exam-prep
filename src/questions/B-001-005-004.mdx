question: "An amateur radio operator with Basic and Morse code qualifications may install an amateur radio station for another person:"
answers:
  - text: "only if the other person is the holder of a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct requirement because Canadian amateur radio regulations mandate that only licensed operators can have amateur radio stations installed and operational. By ensuring the station owner has a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate, ISED prevents unauthorized or improperly supervised radio operations. The installing operator is essentially verifying that the station will be used by a legally qualified individual who understands the technical and regulatory responsibilities of amateur radio."
  - text: "only if the final power input does not exceed 100 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power limitations are not the determining factor for station installation. While power levels are regulated, the critical requirement is the licensure status of the station owner. An amateur radio operator can install a station for someone with a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate, regardless of the station's specific power output."
  - text: "only if the station is for use on one of the VHF bands"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The frequency band of operation is irrelevant to the installation requirements. Station installation depends on the licensure of the station owner, not the specific frequency range being used. An amateur radio operator can install stations for licensed individuals across all authorized amateur radio bands."
  - text: "only if the DC power input to the final stage does not exceed 200 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power input specifications do not determine installation eligibility. The crucial factor is whether the station owner possesses a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate. An amateur radio operator with Basic and Morse code qualifications can install a station for a licensed operator, regardless of the station's power characteristics."

## The Concept: Station Installation and Operator Certification

Amateur radio is a regulated service where only properly licensed individuals can own and operate radio stations. The requirement that an amateur radio station can only be installed for a person holding a valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate is fundamental to maintaining the technical and operational standards of the amateur radio service.

This regulation ensures that every amateur radio station is associated with an operator who has demonstrated:
- Technical competence through examination
- Understanding of operating procedures
- Commitment to responsible spectrum use
- Knowledge of safety and regulatory requirements

### Why Certification Matters

Just like you wouldn't let an unlicensed driver operate a vehicle, amateur radio regulations prevent unqualified individuals from establishing and operating radio stations. The certificate proves that the station owner understands:
- Proper frequency usage
- Interference mitigation
- Technical operating standards
- Emergency communication protocols

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Station Installation Scenarios:
- **Experienced Mentor**: A licensed amateur helps a newly certified operator set up their first station
- **Club Equipment**: A club member with advanced qualifications installs equipment for a Basic-certified club member
- **Professional Installation**: A certified technician sets up a station for a fully licensed amateur radio operator

### ❌ Inappropriate Installation Attempts:
- **Unauthorized Person**: Installing a station for someone without a valid certificate
- **Temporary Loan**: Allowing an uncertified person to operate the installed station
- **Proxy Operation**: Setting up a station intended for use by a non-licensed individual

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Always Verify Certification**: Before installing any station, confirm the owner's current, valid Amateur Radio Operator Certificate
2. **Document Installation**: Maintain records of station setup and the operator's licensing status
3. **Provide Training**: Help new operators understand their legal and technical responsibilities

### For Station Owners:
1. **Maintain Current Certification**: Keep your Amateur Radio Operator Certificate valid
2. **Understand Installation Requirements**: Know the regulations surrounding station setup
3. **Seek Qualified Assistance**: Work with certified operators for complex installations

### Memory Aid:
"**C**ertificate **C**omes **F**irst" - Certification is the fundamental requirement for amateur radio station ownership.
