question: "How many megahertz is 7040 kHz?"
answers:
  - text: "7.040 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "To convert from kilohertz (kHz) to megahertz (MHz), you divide the kilohertz value by 1000. In this case, 7040 kHz ÷ 1000 = 7.040 MHz. This conversion is a fundamental skill in amateur radio for understanding frequency allocations and equipment specifications across different units of frequency measurement."
  - text: "0.740 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of frequency unit conversion. The decimal point is in the wrong place and doesn't represent the correct mathematical relationship between kHz and MHz."
  - text: "70.40 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer moves the decimal point in the wrong direction, multiplying instead of dividing. When converting from kHz to MHz, you always divide by 1000, not multiply."
  - text: "0.074 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly places the decimal point, resulting in a significantly different frequency value that does not match the original 7040 kHz."

## The Concept: Understanding Frequency Units

Frequency is a fundamental measurement in amateur radio, describing the number of cycles per second of an electromagnetic wave. In radio communications, we often use multiple units to express frequency: hertz (Hz), kilohertz (kHz), and megahertz (MHz).

The relationship between these units is straightforward:
- 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz
- 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz = 1,000,000 Hz

When converting between these units, you move the decimal point left or right depending on whether you're converting to a smaller or larger unit. The key rule is: **to convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, divide by 1000**.

### Why Precision Matters in Amateur Radio

Accurate frequency conversion is crucial because:
- Amateur radio bands have specific frequency allocations
- Different modes and activities occur in precise frequency ranges
- International regulations define exact frequency limits
- Precise frequency knowledge prevents interference and ensures legal operation

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Frequency Conversions:
- **7040 kHz = 7.040 MHz**: Standard conversion by dividing by 1000
- **14,200 kHz = 14.200 MHz**: 20-meter amateur band frequency
- **3600 kHz = 3.600 MHz**: 80-meter amateur band frequency

### ❌ Common Conversion Mistakes:
- **Multiplying instead of dividing**
- **Misplacing the decimal point**
- **Confusing units (Hz vs. kHz vs. MHz)**
