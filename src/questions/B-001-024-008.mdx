question: "Which statement is NOT correct?"
answers:
  - text: "Hand-held transmitters are excluded from Safety Code 6 requirements"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This statement is false - hand-held transmitters are NOT excluded from Safety Code 6 requirements. In fact, Safety Code 6 specifically addresses personal, portable, and hand-held transmitters to ensure human exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic energy remains within safe limits. The statement is intentionally incorrect and misleads about radiation safety regulations."
  - text: "Antenna gain, distance, transmitter power and frequency all influence exposure to radio energy"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is entirely correct. These four factors are critical in determining radio frequency energy exposure. Antenna gain affects signal directionality and concentration, distance reduces energy intensity, transmitter power determines total energy output, and frequency impacts how electromagnetic radiation interacts with human tissue and biological systems."
  - text: "Safety Code 6 uses different units for magnetic field strength and electric field strength"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is accurate. Safety Code 6 uses volts per meter (V/m) for electric field strength and amperes per meter (A/m) for magnetic field strength, representing different aspects of electromagnetic radiation measurement and potential biological interaction."
  - text: "Safety Code 6 specifies lower exposure limits for the general public in uncontrolled areas than for controlled areas"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is correct. Safety Code 6 intentionally sets more stringent (lower) exposure limits for the general public in uncontrolled areas compared to controlled areas like professional workplace environments, providing additional protection for individuals who may not be aware of or trained to minimize radio frequency exposure risks."

## The Concept: Radiofrequency Energy and Human Safety

Safety Code 6 is Health Canada's guideline for limiting human exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic energy. It applies to all radio transmitting devices, including amateur radio equipment, cellular phones, broadcast transmitters, and personal communication devices.

The code recognizes that electromagnetic radiation can interact with human tissue, potentially causing thermal and non-thermal biological effects. By establishing scientifically-derived exposure limits, Safety Code 6 ensures that Canadians are protected from potential harmful radiation effects across various frequency ranges and transmission scenarios.

### Key Exposure Factors

Several critical factors determine radiofrequency energy exposure:
- **Transmitter Power**: Higher power increases potential energy exposure
- **Frequency**: Different frequencies interact differently with biological tissues
- **Distance**: Energy intensity decreases dramatically with distance
- **Antenna Characteristics**: Gain and directionality affect energy concentration

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper RF Safety Practices:
- **Amateur Radio Operators**: Maintaining safe distance from high-power antennas
- **Workplace RF Safety**: Using personal protective equipment in high-exposure environments
- **Public Spaces**: Limiting transmitter power in areas with high human traffic

### ❌ Unsafe RF Exposure Scenarios:
- **Close Proximity Transmission**: Operating at maximum power near human bodies
- **Unshielded High-Power Installations**: Transmitters without proper safety barriers
- **Ignoring Cumulative Exposure**: Not considering multiple RF sources

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Distance Management**: Keep safe separation from high-power antennas
2. **Power Control**: Reduce transmission power in confined spaces
3. **Awareness of Surrounding Environment**: Understand potential exposure risks

### For Equipment Design:
1. **Compliance Testing**: Manufacturers must verify compliance with Safety Code 6
2. **Labeling Requirements**: Clear warnings about potential RF exposure
3. **Design Modifications**: Implementing safety features to limit radiation

### Memory Aid:
"**D**istance, **P**ower, **F**requency = **S**afety" (The key factors in managing RF exposure)
