question: "How does an inductor react to AC?"
answers:
  - text: "As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In an AC circuit, an inductor's reactance increases proportionally with frequency. This occurs because inductors oppose changes in current, and at higher frequencies, the current changes more rapidly. The mathematical relationship is expressed in the formula XL = 2πfL, where XL is inductive reactance, f is frequency, and L is inductance. As frequency increases, the reactance increases linearly, creating more opposition to current flow."
  - text: "As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Inductive reactance is independent of the amplitude of the AC signal. The reactance depends on the frequency of the signal and the physical characteristics of the inductor (its inductance), not the signal's voltage or current amplitude. Changing the amplitude does not affect the inductor's opposition to current flow."
  - text: "As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Inductive reactance is not affected by the amplitude of the AC signal. The reactance is determined solely by the frequency of the signal and the inductor's physical properties. Changes in signal amplitude do not modify the inductor's opposition to current flow."
  - text: "As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is the opposite of how inductors actually behave. As frequency increases, an inductor's reactance increases, creating more opposition to current flow. The relationship is linear and described by the formula XL = 2πfL, where increasing frequency directly increases inductive reactance."

## The Concept: Inductors in AC Circuits

An inductor is an electrical component made of a coil of wire that creates a magnetic field when current flows through it. In direct current (DC) circuits, inductors behave like simple wire connections. However, in alternating current (AC) circuits, inductors display a fascinating and critical property called **inductive reactance**.

Inductive reactance is the opposition an inductor presents to changing current. Unlike resistance, which remains constant, reactance varies with frequency. As the frequency of an AC signal increases, an inductor creates more opposition to current flow, effectively "pushing back" against the changing electromagnetic field.

The fundamental principle is rooted in electromagnetic induction: when current changes rapidly, the inductor generates a counter-electromagnetic force that resists that change. Higher frequencies mean more rapid current changes, resulting in greater opposition.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Inductor Behavior in Different Scenarios:
- **Audio Crossover Networks**: Inductors used in speaker systems block high-frequency signals more effectively than low-frequency signals
- **Radio Frequency Filters**: High-frequency signals are attenuated more strongly by inductors
- **Power Supply Design**: Inductors help smooth out rapid current fluctuations in electronic circuits

### ❌ Common Misconceptions:
- **Amplitude Doesn't Matter**: Signal strength doesn't change inductor reactance
- **DC Behavior is Different**: Inductors behave very differently in DC versus AC circuits
- **All Frequencies Treated Equally**: Inductors provide varying levels of opposition across different frequencies

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Design:
1. **Filter Design**: Create low-pass and high-pass filters by combining inductors with capacitors
2. **Signal Conditioning**: Use inductors to smooth out rapid current changes
3. **Impedance Matching**: Leverage inductor properties in radio frequency circuits

### For Amateur Radio:
1. **Antenna Matching**: Use inductors in antenna tuning units to optimize signal transfer
2. **Noise Reduction**: Employ inductors in RF chokes to suppress unwanted high-frequency signals
3. **Circuit Protection**: Use inductors to limit current in sensitive electronic components

### Memory Aid:
"**F**requency **U**p, **R**eactance **F**lies" - As Frequency Up, Reactance Flies (increases)
