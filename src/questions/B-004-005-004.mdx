question: "Which electrode on a vacuum tube is operated with the highest positive voltage?"
answers:
  - text: "Plate"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a vacuum tube, the plate (also called the anode) is operated at the highest positive voltage relative to the cathode. This high positive voltage attracts electrons emitted by the heated cathode, creating the basic electron flow that enables the tube to function as an amplifying or switching device. The plate's high positive potential is essential for collecting and controlling electron current through the tube."
  - text: "Collector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The term 'collector' is typically associated with transistors, not vacuum tubes. While transistors do have a collector electrode, this is a different type of electronic component with distinct operating principles from vacuum tubes. Using 'collector' in the context of vacuum tube operation is technically incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of electronic component terminology."
  - text: "Cathode"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The cathode is actually operated at the lowest potential in a vacuum tube. It is the electron-emitting electrode, heated by a filament or heater, which releases electrons that are then attracted to the positively charged plate. The cathode serves as the source of electrons, not the highest voltage point in the tube's circuit."
  - text: "Grid"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The grid is an intermediate electrode in a vacuum tube, typically operated at a negative voltage relative to the cathode. Its primary function is to control the electron flow between the cathode and plate by creating an electrostatic field that modulates the electron current. The grid is not the highest voltage electrode and plays a regulatory rather than a high-voltage role in the tube's operation."

## The Concept: Vacuum Tube Electrode Dynamics

A vacuum tube is an electronic device that controls electron flow in a sealed glass or metal envelope from which air has been removed. It consists of several key electrodes that work together to manipulate electrical signals, with each electrode playing a specific role in electron management.

The fundamental principle of vacuum tube operation is electron emission and control. The cathode, typically heated by a filament, releases electrons into the vacuum. These electrons are then guided and controlled by other electrodes, with the plate (anode) serving as the primary collection point for this electron flow.

### Voltage Hierarchy in Vacuum Tubes

In a typical vacuum tube circuit, electrodes are arranged with specific voltage relationships:
- **Cathode**: Lowest potential, electron source
- **Grid**: Negative potential, electron flow control
- **Plate (Anode)**: Highest positive potential, electron collection point

This voltage hierarchy creates an electrostatic environment that allows the tube to function as an amplifier, oscillator, or switch.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Typical Vacuum Tube Voltage Configurations:
- **Audio Amplifier Tube**: Plate at +250V, Cathode at 0V, Grid at -10V
- **Transmitter Tube**: Plate at +500V, Cathode at ground, Grid at variable negative potential
- **Rectifier Tube**: Plate at high positive voltage, Cathode at ground potential

### ❌ Incorrect Voltage Arrangements:
- **Reversed Polarity**: Placing highest voltage on cathode would prevent electron emission
- **Grid at Highest Potential**: Would block electron flow and prevent tube operation
- **Floating Plate Voltage**: Would result in no electron collection and no signal amplification
