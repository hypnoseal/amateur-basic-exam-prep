question: "If a neighbour reports television interference on one or two channels only when you transmit on 15 metres, what is probably the cause of the interference?"
answers:
  - text: "Harmonic emissions from your transmitter"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Harmonic emissions from a transmitter operating on 15 meters (approximately 21 MHz) can directly interfere with specific television channels. These harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency that can fall within TV broadcast bands, causing interference on adjacent or nearby channels. Unlike broadband noise, harmonics are precise, predictable signals that can selectively disrupt specific television frequencies."
  - text: "Splatter due to overmodulation"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Splatter involves wide, irregular signal spreading caused by excessive modulation, which would typically affect multiple channels or a broader frequency range. In this scenario, the interference is limited to one or two specific channels, which points more directly to harmonic emissions rather than modulation issues."
  - text: "Television receiver front-end overload"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Front-end overload typically causes widespread interference across multiple channels or the entire TV reception, not just one or two specific channels. The selective nature of the reported interference suggests a more targeted issue like harmonic emissions rather than a general receiver sensitivity problem."
  - text: "Parasitic oscillations from your transmitter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Parasitic oscillations would generate more random and unpredictable interference patterns. The specific, channel-limited nature of the reported TV interference is more consistent with harmonic emissions from the 15-meter transmission."

## The Concept: Harmonic Emissions in Radio Transmission

Harmonics are electromagnetic signals generated at integer multiples of a fundamental transmission frequency. When an amateur radio operator transmits on 15 meters (approximately 21 MHz), the harmonic frequencies can include 42 MHz (2nd harmonic), 63 MHz (3rd harmonic), and so on.

Television broadcast bands are strategically allocated frequencies that can coincidentally overlap with these harmonic frequencies. This means a seemingly clean 21 MHz transmission can produce unwanted signals that directly interfere with specific TV channels, creating a targeted interference pattern that affects only one or two channels.

### The Physics of Harmonic Generation

Every non-linear electronic system—including transmitters—can generate harmonics. While modern transmitters include filtering to minimize these emissions, some harmonic energy inevitably escapes. These harmonics result from the complex interaction of electronic components that don't respond perfectly linearly to the input signal.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Harmonic Interference Scenarios:
- **15m Amateur Band Transmission**: 21 MHz signal producing 42 MHz second harmonic interfering with VHF television channels
- **10m Amateur Band Transmission**: 28 MHz signal generating 56 MHz harmonic disrupting specific TV frequencies
- **Poorly Filtered Transmitter**: Older or improperly maintained equipment more likely to generate significant harmonic emissions

### ❌ Non-Harmonic Interference Patterns:
- **Broadband Noise**: Affects multiple channels simultaneously
- **Power Line Interference**: Creates consistent, wide-spectrum noise
- **Receiver Desensitization**: Reduces overall reception quality across channels

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Use Low-Pass Filters**: Install filters at transmitter output to suppress harmonics
2. **Check Transmitter Alignment**: Ensure transmitter is properly tuned and calibrated
3. **Use Dummy Loads for Testing**: Verify transmitter performance without radiating signals

### For Interference Resolution:
1. **Communicate with Neighbor**: Explain the technical nature of the interference
2. **Conduct Signal Analysis**: Use spectrum analyzer to identify specific harmonic frequencies
3. **Implement Mitigation Strategies**: Add external filtering or adjust transmission parameters

### Memory Aid:
"**H**armonics **H**appen **H**igher" - Harmonics occur at integer multiples of your fundamental frequency.
