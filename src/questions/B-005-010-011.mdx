question: "In general, the reactance of inductors increases with:"
answers:
  - text: "increasing AC frequency"
    correct: true
    explanation: "As the AC frequency increases, the reactance of an inductor also increases. This occurs because higher frequencies cause the inductor to generate a stronger opposing electromagnetic field, which increases the inductor's impedance and reduces the current flow through the circuit. The mathematical relationship is expressed in the formula XL = 2πfL, where XL is inductive reactance, f is frequency, and L is inductance."
  - text: "decreasing AC frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is the opposite of how inductors actually behave. As AC frequency decreases, the inductive reactance also decreases, allowing more current to flow through the inductor. At very low frequencies (approaching DC), an inductor behaves almost like a short circuit with minimal opposition to current flow."
  - text: "decreasing applied voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The applied voltage does not directly affect an inductor's reactance. Reactance is a function of frequency and the inductor's physical characteristics, not the voltage magnitude. While voltage can affect current flow, it does not change the inductor's inherent opposition to current changes."
  - text: "increasing applied voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Increasing the applied voltage does not impact an inductor's reactance. The inductor's opposition to current change is determined by its physical properties and the frequency of the alternating current, not the voltage level applied to it."

## The Concept: Inductive Reactance and Frequency Interaction

An inductor is an electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. Unlike a pure resistor, which always opposes current flow equally, an inductor's opposition (called reactance) varies with the frequency of the alternating current.

The key principle is that inductors generate a magnetic field that opposes changes in current. As the frequency increases, the rate of current change becomes more rapid, causing the inductor to generate a stronger opposing electromagnetic field. This results in higher reactance and less current flow through the circuit.

### The Mathematical Foundation

The relationship between frequency and inductive reactance is described by the formula:

XL = 2πfL

Where:
- XL is inductive reactance (measured in ohms, Ω)
- π (pi) is approximately 3.14159
- f is the frequency in hertz (Hz)
- L is the inductance in henries (H)

This formula shows a direct linear relationship: as frequency increases, reactance increases proportionally.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Increasing Frequency Effects:
- **High-Frequency Radio Circuits**: At higher frequencies, inductors become more effective at blocking signal paths
- **RF Filters**: Use frequency-dependent inductor behavior to selectively block or pass specific frequency ranges
- **Transformer Design**: High-frequency transformers require special core materials to manage increasing reactance

### ❌ Frequency Misconceptions:
- **DC Circuits**: At zero frequency (DC), an inductor acts like a short circuit with minimal opposition
- **Audio Circuits**: Low-frequency audio signals pass through inductors more easily than high-frequency signals
- **Voltage Myths**: Changing voltage does not alter the inductor's frequency-dependent behavior
