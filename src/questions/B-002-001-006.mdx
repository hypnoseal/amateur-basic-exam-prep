question: "How do you call another station on a repeater if you know the station's call sign?"
answers:
  - text: "Say the station's call sign, then identify your own station"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the standard, professional procedure for making contact on an amateur radio repeater. By first saying the specific call sign of the station you want to contact, you clearly signal your intent to communicate with that particular station. Following this with your own call sign completes the proper identification procedure, ensuring clear communication and adherence to amateur radio protocols."
  - text: "Say \"break, break,\" then say the station's call sign"
    correct: false
    explanation: "\"Break, break\" is CB (Citizens Band) radio terminology, not appropriate for amateur radio repeater communication. Amateur radio has its own established communication protocols that prioritize clear, precise, and professional station identification. Using CB slang would be considered improper and potentially confusing to other repeater users."
  - text: "Say \"CQ\" three times, then say the station's call sign"
    correct: false
    explanation: "\"CQ\" is used for general, undirected calling on simplex frequencies, typically when you want to contact any available station. On a repeater, where multiple stations are likely monitoring, a general \"CQ\" call is inefficient and inappropriate. When you know a specific station's call sign, you should directly call that station."
  - text: "Wait for the station to call \"CQ,\" then answer it"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This approach is passive and inappropriate when you specifically want to contact a known station. On a repeater, waiting for a random \"CQ\" call from the station you want to contact is inefficient and unlikely. When you know a station's call sign, you should proactively call them directly."

# Proper Repeater Contact: Precision in Amateur Radio Communication

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The correct procedure for calling a specific station on a repeater
- Why precise station identification is crucial in amateur radio
- The differences between repeater and simplex communication protocols
- How to maintain professional communication standards

## The Concept: Targeted Repeater Communication

Amateur radio repeaters are shared community resources designed to extend communication range by retransmitting signals. Unlike simplex communications, repeaters serve multiple users simultaneously, requiring clear, purposeful communication protocols.

When you know a specific station's call sign and want to contact them on a repeater, the most efficient and professional approach is to **directly call that station by their call sign, followed by your own call sign**. This method immediately:
- Identifies the intended recipient
- Signals your desire to communicate
- Identifies yourself to all listeners
- Follows established amateur radio communication standards

### The Importance of Precise Identification

In amateur radio, call signs are more than just identifiers—they're legal credentials issued by national regulatory authorities. Using call signs correctly demonstrates professionalism, ensures regulatory compliance, and maintains the technical integrity of the amateur radio service.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Repeater Call Procedures:
- **"VE3ABC, this is VE7XYZ"**: Clear, direct, follows standard protocol
- **"VA2DEF, VE4GHI calling"**: Another correct way to initiate contact
- **"VE5JKL mobile, VE6MNO"**: Appropriate when station configuration is relevant

### ❌ Inappropriate Contact Methods:
- **"Break, break, VE3ABC"**: CB radio terminology, not amateur radio protocol
- **"CQ, CQ, CQ, VE3ABC"**: Inefficient and inappropriate for repeater use
- **Silently waiting for the station to call CQ**: Passive and unlikely to succeed

## Practical Applications

### For Repeater Users:
1. **Listen First**: Always monitor the repeater briefly before transmitting
2. **Be Specific**: When you know the station you want to contact, call them directly
3. **Be Concise**: Keep initial contact brief and to the point

### Communication Best Practices:
1. **Identify Clearly**: Always use full call signs
2. **Pause After Calling**: Allow the called station time to respond
3. **Respect Shared Resources**: Remember multiple users may be listening
