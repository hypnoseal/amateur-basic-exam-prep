question: "A filter attenuates frequencies below its cut-off frequency of 60 MHz. What type of filter is it?"
answers:
  - text: "High-pass"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A high-pass filter allows frequencies above its cut-off frequency to pass through while attenuating (reducing) frequencies below that point. In this case, with a 60 MHz cut-off frequency, the filter will block all frequencies below 60 MHz and allow frequencies above 60 MHz to pass through. This makes it a classic high-pass filter configuration, which is commonly used in radio frequency circuits to eliminate low-frequency noise or isolate higher-frequency signals."
  - text: "Low-pass"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A low-pass filter does the opposite of this filter's behavior. A low-pass filter allows frequencies below its cut-off frequency to pass through while attenuating frequencies above that point. In this scenario, where the filter blocks frequencies below 60 MHz, the filter cannot be a low-pass filter."
  - text: "Band-pass"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A band-pass filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass through while attenuating frequencies both below and above that range. This filter's description of blocking frequencies below 60 MHz does not match the characteristics of a band-pass filter, which would allow a specific frequency band to pass through."
  - text: "Notch"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A notch filter is designed to block a very narrow, specific frequency or a very small range of frequencies while allowing all other frequencies to pass through. This filter's description of blocking all frequencies below 60 MHz does not match the characteristics of a notch filter."

## The Concept: High-Pass Filter Fundamentals

A high-pass filter is an electronic circuit that allows high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating (reducing) low-frequency signals. Think of it like a gate that only opens for signals above a certain frequency threshold - in this case, 60 MHz.

The **cut-off frequency** is the critical point where the filter begins to significantly reduce signal strength. For a high-pass filter, this means frequencies below the cut-off are progressively weakened, while frequencies above the cut-off pass through with minimal loss.

This behavior is crucial in many electronic applications, including amateur radio, where you might want to eliminate low-frequency noise, isolate high-frequency signals, or prevent unwanted signal components from interfering with your communication.

### The Physics Behind Filtering

High-pass filters typically use combinations of capacitors and inductors to create frequency-dependent impedance. As frequency increases, the filter's opposition to signal flow decreases, allowing higher frequencies to pass more easily while blocking lower frequencies.

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Interference Rejection**: Use high-pass filters to remove low-frequency noise from VHF and UHF communications
2. **Signal Conditioning**: Improve receiver performance by blocking unwanted low-frequency components
3. **Harmonic Suppression**: Help manage signal purity in transmitter designs

### Filter Design Considerations:
1. **Determine Required Cut-Off Frequency**: Match filter characteristics to your specific communication needs
2. **Consider Filter Slope**: How quickly the filter attenuates signals below the cut-off
3. **Evaluate Insertion Loss**: The signal strength reduction introduced by the filter itself
