question: "Your neighbour's television receiver malfunctions when you are transmitting. What provision in Electromagnetic Compatibility Advisory Bulletin EMCAB-2 deems your transmission is the cause?"
answers:
  - text: "The field strength of your emissions, on your neighbour's premises, is above Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's specified immunity criteria"
    correct: true
    explanation: "EMCAB-2 establishes specific electromagnetic compatibility standards that define when an amateur radio transmission is considered the source of interference. If the field strength of your radio emissions exceeds the immunity threshold on your neighbor's property, you are deemed responsible for the television malfunction, regardless of whether you intentionally caused the interference."
  - text: "You are transmitting at or below your maximum permitted power"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Transmitting within legal power limits does not automatically absolve you of responsibility for causing interference. Even low-power transmissions can cause reception problems if they generate strong electromagnetic fields that exceed the receiver's immunity specifications."
  - text: "The malfunction continues when you stop transmitting"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While persistent interference is significant, EMCAB-2 focuses on the causal relationship between your transmission and the malfunction, not just its continuation. The standard is concerned with whether your emissions exceed specified immunity criteria, not the duration of the interference."
  - text: "The field strength of your emissions, on your neighbour's premises, is below Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's specified immunity criteria"
    correct: false
    explanation: "If the field strength is below the specified immunity criteria, your transmission would not be considered the cause of the television malfunction. This scenario would suggest the problem lies with the television receiver's design or another interference source."

# Electromagnetic Compatibility: Understanding Radio Interference and Regulatory Standards

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The concept of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) in amateur radio
- How ISED defines interference and operator responsibilities
- The role of immunity criteria in protecting consumer electronics
- Practical strategies for minimizing radio frequency interference

## The Concept: Electromagnetic Compatibility and Interference

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the ability of electronic devices to operate correctly in their intended electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to other devices. In amateur radio, this means ensuring your radio transmissions do not unreasonably disrupt other electronic systems.

The EMCAB-2 (Electromagnetic Compatibility Advisory Bulletin) provides guidelines that help determine when an amateur radio transmission is considered the source of interference. The key metric is the field strength of radio emissions at the location of the affected device, compared against predetermined immunity criteria established by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED).

### Why Immunity Criteria Matter

Electronic devices are designed with a certain level of immunity—the ability to resist interference from external electromagnetic signals. When your radio emissions create a field strength that exceeds these immunity thresholds, you become legally responsible for the resulting malfunction, even if you're operating within your licensed power limits.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Scenarios Demonstrating EMC Principles:
- **Strong HF Transmission Near TV**: Your 100W SSB transmission creates RF fields that overwhelm a nearby television's input stages
- **Harmonic Radiation**: Improper filtering allows harmonics to generate strong signals that disrupt consumer electronics
- **Proximity Effects**: Close-range transmissions have higher potential for causing interference due to stronger field strengths

### ❌ Misunderstandings About Interference:
- **"I'm Within Power Limits"**: Legal power doesn't guarantee compatibility
- **"It's an Old TV"**: Age of equipment doesn't change interference responsibilities
- **"I Didn't Mean To"**: Intent is irrelevant; actual interference is what matters

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Use Low-Pass Filters**: Minimize harmonics that could cause interference
2. **Check Antenna System**: Ensure proper tuning and minimal spurious emissions
3. **Communicate with Neighbors**: Proactively discuss potential interference issues
4. **Be Prepared to Troubleshoot**: Have strategies ready to mitigate RFI problems

### Interference Mitigation Techniques:
1. **RF Chokes**: Prevent RF from traveling on external cable shields
2. **Ferrite Beads**: Reduce common-mode currents that can cause interference
3. **Proper Grounding**: Minimize unwanted RF paths
4. **Collaboration**: Work with affected parties to find solutions
