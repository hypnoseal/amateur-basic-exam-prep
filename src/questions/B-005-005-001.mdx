question: "In a parallel circuit with a voltage source and several branch resistors, how is the total current related to the current in the branch resistors?"
answers:
  - text: "It equals the sum of the branch current through each resistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is correct.]"
  - text: "It equals the average of the branch current through each resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is incorrect.]"
  - text: "It decreases as more parallel resistors are added to the circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "[TODO: Draft explanation why answer is incorrect.]"
  - text: "It is the sum of each resistor's voltage drop multiplied by the total number of resistors"
