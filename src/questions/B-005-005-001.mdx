question: "In a parallel circuit with a voltage source and several branch resistors, how is the total current related to the current in the branch resistors?"
answers:
  - text: "It equals the sum of the branch current through each resistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a parallel circuit, the total current is the algebraic sum of the individual branch currents. According to Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), the current entering a junction must equal the current leaving that junction. Each parallel branch receives the full circuit voltage, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each parallel path, determined by the individual branch resistances."
  - text: "It equals the average of the branch current through each resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because the total current in a parallel circuit is the sum, not the average, of the branch currents. Each branch conducts current independently based on its resistance, and these currents are added together, not averaged."
  - text: "It decreases as more parallel resistors are added to the circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Actually, adding parallel resistors increases the total current drawn from the voltage source. As more low-resistance paths are added, the overall circuit resistance decreases, allowing more current to flow from the voltage source."
  - text: "It is the sum of each resistor's voltage drop multiplied by the total number of resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is mathematically and electrically nonsensical. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is equal to the source voltage, and the total current is the sum of branch currents, not a calculation involving voltage drops and the number of resistors."

## The Concept: Current Paths in Parallel Circuits

A parallel circuit is a configuration where electrical components are connected across the same two points, creating multiple independent current paths. In this arrangement, each component (in this case, resistors) receives the full source voltage, but the current is distributed differently based on each component's resistance.

The fundamental principle governing parallel circuits is **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**, which states that the total current entering a junction must equal the total current leaving that junction. In practical terms, this means the total current from the voltage source is the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch.

### The Physics of Parallel Current Flow

Imagine water flowing through multiple pipes connected to the same water tank. Each pipe (parallel resistor) allows water (current) to flow, with the total flow rate being the sum of individual pipe flows. The key difference is that in electrical circuits, each "pipe" (resistor) receives the same pressure (voltage), but allows different amounts of flow (current) based on its internal characteristics.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Parallel Current Summation:
- **Three Resistor Circuit**: If branch currents are 2A, 3A, and 4A, the total current will be 9A
- **Solar Panel Arrays**: Parallel solar panels combine their current outputs while maintaining the same voltage
- **Multiple LED Circuits**: Each LED receives full voltage but contributes to total current draw

### ❌ Incorrect Parallel Current Assumptions:
- **Averaging Currents**: Believing total current is an average instead of a sum
- **Constant Current**: Thinking adding parallel paths doesn't change total current
- **Voltage-Based Calculations**: Trying to calculate current using voltage drop methods
