question: "A signal is composed of a fundamental frequency of 2 kHz and another of 4 kHz. What name is given to the 4 kHz signal?"
answers:
  - text: "Harmonic"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In this scenario, the 4 kHz signal is a harmonic of the fundamental 2 kHz frequency. A harmonic is a frequency that is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. Since 4 kHz is exactly twice the fundamental frequency of 2 kHz, it is specifically the second harmonic of the original signal. Harmonics are critical in understanding signal composition, wave propagation, and potential sources of interference in electronic and radio systems."
  - text: "Alias"
    correct: false
    explanation: "An alias is a spurious frequency that can appear in digital signal processing when a signal is sampled at a rate lower than the Nyquist rate. In this analog frequency scenario, the term 'alias' is not applicable. The 4 kHz signal is a direct mathematical relationship to the fundamental frequency, not a sampling artifact."
  - text: "Sub-harmonic"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A sub-harmonic would be a frequency that is a fractional multiple of the fundamental frequency (like 1 kHz, which would be 1/2 of the 2 kHz fundamental). In this case, the 4 kHz signal is a whole-number multiple of the fundamental, making it a harmonic, not a sub-harmonic."
  - text: "Intermodulation"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Intermodulation occurs when multiple frequencies interact in a non-linear system, creating additional frequencies that are sums or differences of the original signals. In this specific example, we have a straightforward relationship between a fundamental frequency and its harmonic, not an intermodulation product."

## The Concept: Harmonics in Signal Theory

A **harmonic** is a frequency that is an integer multiple of a fundamental frequency. In musical terms, think of how a guitar string vibrates - when you pluck a string, it doesn't just vibrate at its fundamental frequency, but also at whole-number multiples of that frequency, creating rich, complex sound.

In the context of signals and waves, the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency in a periodic waveform. Any additional frequencies that are whole-number multiples of this fundamental are called harmonics. The first harmonic is always the fundamental frequency itself, with subsequent harmonics being integer multiples.

### Mathematical Relationships

For a fundamental frequency f, harmonics are calculated as:
- First harmonic: 1 × f (the fundamental frequency)
- Second harmonic: 2 × f
- Third harmonic: 3 × f
- And so on...

In our specific example of a 2 kHz fundamental and a 4 kHz signal, 4 kHz is exactly 2 × 2 kHz, making it the second harmonic.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Harmonic Scenarios:
- **Musical Instrument**: A guitar string vibrating at 440 Hz (A4 note) also produces harmonics at 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, etc.
- **Radio Transmission**: An amateur radio transmitter on 7.1 MHz will naturally generate harmonics at 14.2 MHz, 21.3 MHz, and higher frequencies
- **Electronic Circuits**: Non-linear components can generate harmonic frequencies that can cause interference

### ❌ Non-Harmonic Frequency Relationships:
- **Sub-harmonics**: Frequencies that are fractional multiples of the fundamental
- **Intermodulation Products**: Frequencies created by the interaction of multiple signals in non-linear systems
- **Alias Frequencies**: Artifacts in digital signal processing caused by insufficient sampling rates
