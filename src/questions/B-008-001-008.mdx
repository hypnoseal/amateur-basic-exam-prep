question: "Two or more strong signals mix in your receiver to produce interference on a desired frequency. What is this called?"
answers:
- text: "Intermodulation interference"
  correct: true
  explanation: "Intermodulation interference occurs when two or more strong signals combine in a non-linear device (like a receiver's amplification stages) to create additional, unwanted frequencies. These new spurious signals can interfere with the desired communication frequency, causing distortion or complete signal blockage. The non-linear mixing happens in semiconductor junctions, creating sum and difference frequencies that can fall on the same frequency as the desired signal."
- text: "Harmonic interference"
  correct: false
  explanation: "Harmonic interference involves signals at multiples of a fundamental frequency (like 7 MHz and 14 MHz), whereas intermodulation interference involves mixing of different strong signals to create new, unintended frequencies. Harmonics are generated by a single signal, not by the interaction of multiple signals as in intermodulation."
- text: "Capture effect"
  correct: false
  explanation: "Capture effect is a phenomenon where a receiver locks onto the strongest signal in a given frequency, effectively blocking weaker signals. Unlike intermodulation interference, capture effect doesn't involve the generation of new frequencies through signal mixing, but rather selective signal reception based on signal strength."
- text: "Front-end desensitization"
  correct: false
  explanation: "Front-end desensitization occurs when strong signals overwhelm a receiver's front-end circuitry, reducing its ability to detect weak signals. While related to signal interference, it doesn't involve the active mixing of signals to create new frequencies like intermodulation interference does."

## The Concept: Signal Mixing and Non-Linear Devices

**Intermodulation interference** is a complex phenomenon that occurs when two or more strong radio signals interact within a non-linear electronic device, typically in a receiver's amplification stages. Non-linear devices are components that don't respond to signals in a perfectly proportional manner - instead, they create additional, unintended frequencies through their inherent electronic characteristics.

Imagine two powerful radio signals entering a receiver simultaneously. As they pass through transistors, diodes, or other semiconductor components, they don't simply coexist peacefully. Instead, they interact in ways that generate new, spurious frequencies. These new signals can fall exactly on the frequency you're trying to receive, causing interference, distortion, or complete signal blockage.

### The Physics of Signal Mixing

When strong signals enter a non-linear device, they create sum and difference frequencies according to mathematical principles. If you have signals at 14 MHz and 21 MHz, for example, intermodulation products might appear at frequencies like 7 MHz, 35 MHz, or other combinations. These unexpected signals can cause significant problems in crowded radio spectrum environments.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Classic Intermodulation Scenarios:
- **Crowded Repeater Sites**: Multiple high-power transmitters on nearby towers creating interference
- **Contesting Environments**: Many strong signals simultaneously operating in close frequency proximity
- **Urban Radio Environments**: Dense cellular, broadcast, and amateur radio signals increasing mixing potential

### ❌ Non-Intermodulation Interference Types:
- **Harmonic Interference**: Single-frequency signals generating predictable multiples
- **Adjacent Channel Interference**: Signals in nearby frequencies bleeding over
- **Front-End Overload**: Strong signals overwhelming receiver sensitivity without creating new frequencies

## Practical Applications

### For Receiver Design:
1. **Use High-Quality Front-Ends**: Receivers with better linearity reduce intermodulation potential
2. **Implement Filtering**: Narrow bandpass filters can reduce unwanted signal mixing
3. **Use Attenuators**: Reducing strong signal levels can minimize non-linear interactions

### For Field Operations:
1. **Survey Antenna Locations**: Understand local high-power signal sources
2. **Use Preselectors**: Additional filtering before the receiver's first amplification stage
3. **Monitor Signal Quality**: Watch for unexpected noise or signal degradation
