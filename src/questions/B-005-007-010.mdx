question: "What is the shape of the waveform of the electricity supplied from a household receptacle?"
answers:
  - text: "Sine wave (sinusoidal)"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In North America, household electricity is delivered as a pure sine wave with a standard frequency of 60 Hz, alternating between positive and negative voltage 60 times per second. This smooth, continuous curved waveform represents the most efficient and stable form of electrical power distribution, minimizing harmonic distortion and providing consistent power quality for electronic devices and appliances."
  - text: "Complex wave"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A complex wave contains multiple frequency components and irregular shape, which does not describe standard household electrical power. While complex waves exist in some electrical systems, standard household electricity maintains a pure, predictable sine wave pattern."
  - text: "Modified square wave"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Modified square waves have abrupt transitions and flat top/bottom sections, unlike the smooth curve of standard household electricity. This type of waveform is typically associated with some lower-quality inverters or specialized power generation systems, not standard electrical grid power."
  - text: "Pulse wave"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Pulse waves are characterized by sudden, rectangular voltage transitions with significant time spent at zero voltage, which is not representative of standard household electrical power distribution. Household electricity maintains a continuous, smooth voltage transition typical of a sine wave."

## The Concept: Sine Wave Electrical Power

Electrical power distributed through household receptacles represents a remarkable example of precise, engineered energy transmission. In North America, this power follows a pure sine wave pattern—a smooth, continuous curved waveform that oscillates predictably between positive and negative voltage 60 times per second (60 Hz).

The sine wave's shape is not arbitrary but fundamentally linked to how electrical power is generated. Most electrical generators, including those in power plants, produce electricity by rotating a conductor through a magnetic field. This rotational motion naturally creates a sinusoidal voltage output, representing the most efficient and stable method of electrical energy transmission.

### The Mathematics of Sine Waves

A sine wave can be described mathematically as a smooth, periodic oscillation where voltage follows the mathematical sine function. This means the voltage rises and falls in a perfectly symmetrical, predictable curve, with equal time spent above and below the zero voltage line.
