question: "Except for one band, what is the allowed bandwidth on amateur radio bands between 7 MHz and 25 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "6 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "6 kHz is the standard maximum bandwidth allowed on most amateur radio bands between 7 MHz and 25 MHz, with the exception of one specific band. This bandwidth limitation helps manage spectrum efficiency, prevent interference, and ensure multiple stations can operate simultaneously within the same frequency range. The 6 kHz limit applies to most modes of transmission, including single sideband (SSB), digital modes, and certain forms of amplitude modulation."
  - text: "15 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "15 kHz exceeds the standard bandwidth allocation for most amateur radio bands between 7 MHz and 25 MHz. Such a wide bandwidth would cause unnecessary interference and waste valuable spectrum resources. This width would prevent multiple stations from operating simultaneously and violate ISED spectrum management regulations."
  - text: "20 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "20 kHz is significantly wider than the permitted bandwidth for most amateur radio bands between 7 MHz and 25 MHz. Such a broad transmission would create excessive interference and prevent other operators from using the same frequency range. This bandwidth would be considered inefficient and inappropriate for amateur radio operations."
  - text: "30 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "30 kHz is far beyond the allowed bandwidth for amateur radio bands between 7 MHz and 25 MHz. This extremely wide transmission would cause massive interference, violate spectrum allocation rules, and prevent multiple stations from using the same frequency range. Such a transmission would be considered a serious violation of amateur radio operating practices."

## The Concept: Bandwidth Management in Amateur Radio

Amateur radio operates under strict bandwidth regulations to ensure efficient use of limited radio spectrum. Between 7 MHz and 25 MHz, most amateur bands are limited to a maximum bandwidth of 6 kHz, with one specific band being an exception to this rule.

Bandwidth represents the range of frequencies used to transmit a signal. Wider bandwidths consume more spectrum space, potentially causing interference with other stations. By limiting bandwidths, regulators like ISED ensure that multiple operators can simultaneously use the same general frequency range without disrupting each other's communications.

### Spectrum Efficiency Principles

The 6 kHz bandwidth limitation reflects a fundamental radio communication principle: **maximum information transfer with minimum spectrum occupation**. This approach allows:
- More stations to operate simultaneously
- Reduced potential for interference
- More efficient use of limited radio spectrum
- Preservation of international frequency allocations

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Bandwidth Usage:
- **SSB Voice Transmission**: Typically uses 2.7-3 kHz of bandwidth
- **Digital Modes**: Most fit comfortably within 6 kHz
- **Narrow-band Data Modes**: Often use less than 2 kHz

### ❌ Bandwidth Violation Scenarios:
- **Overmodulated SSB**: Spreads beyond 6 kHz, causing interference
- **Improperly Configured Digital Modes**: Transmitting at maximum power across wide frequency ranges
- **Untuned Transmitters**: Creating unnecessary spectral spread

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Mode Selection**: Choose transmission modes that fit within 6 kHz
2. **Equipment Tuning**: Ensure transmitters are properly aligned
3. **Interference Avoidance**: Monitor and adjust transmission characteristics

### For Different Bands:
1. **HF Bands**: Strict 6 kHz limitation promotes efficient use
2. **Contest Operations**: Precise bandwidth management is crucial
3. **Emergency Communications**: Bandwidth efficiency ensures clear, reliable communication

### Memory Aid:
"**S**ix **K**Hz **K**eeps **K**ommunication **K**lear" - Remember the standard bandwidth limit!
