question: "Which semiconductor device has a gate, a drain and a source?"
answers:
  - text: "Field-effect transistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A field-effect transistor (FET) is a three-terminal semiconductor device characterized by its unique gate, drain, and source terminals. Unlike other transistor types, the FET controls current flow using an electric field applied to the gate, which modulates the conductivity of a channel connecting the drain and source. This design allows for efficient voltage-controlled current amplification and switching in electronic circuits."
  - text: "Point-contact transistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The point-contact transistor, an early transistor design developed in the 1940s, uses two closely spaced metal contacts on a semiconductor material. It typically has only two primary terminals and does not have a gate, drain, and source configuration like a field-effect transistor. This historic transistor type has largely been replaced by more modern semiconductor designs."
  - text: "Bipolar transistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Bipolar transistors have three terminals (collector, base, and emitter), but these are different from the gate, drain, and source terminals found in field-effect transistors. Bipolar transistors operate by current flow through junctions, using both majority and minority charge carriers, which is fundamentally different from the field-effect transistor's voltage-controlled operation."
  - text: "Unijunction transistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A unijunction transistor is a two-terminal device with asymmetrical characteristics, primarily used in switching and oscillator circuits. It does not have a gate, drain, and source configuration like a field-effect transistor. Instead, it has an emitter and two base connections, making it structurally and functionally distinct from FETs."

## The Concept: Field-Effect Transistor Architecture

A field-effect transistor (FET) represents a sophisticated semiconductor device that controls electrical current through an ingenious three-terminal design. Unlike other transistor types, FETs use an electric field to modulate current flow, creating a voltage-controlled current source that forms the backbone of modern electronic systems.

The three critical terminals of a FET each play a unique role:
- **Gate**: The control terminal that creates an electric field to manage current flow
- **Drain**: The terminal where current exits the device
- **Source**: The terminal where current enters the device

### The Voltage-Controlled Current Mechanism

When a voltage is applied to the gate, it creates an electric field that either enhances or restricts the conductivity of the channel between the drain and source. This allows the FET to function as an efficient voltage-controlled switch or amplifier, with minimal power consumption compared to current-controlled transistors.
