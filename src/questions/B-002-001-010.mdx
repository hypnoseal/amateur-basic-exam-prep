question: "What is the accepted way to ask someone about their location when using a repeater?"
answers:
  - text: "Where are you?"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In amateur radio, particularly on repeaters, the most straightforward and professional way to ask about location is simply to ask 'Where are you?' This direct approach follows standard communication protocols, avoids unnecessary jargon, and clearly communicates your intent. Unlike CB radio codes or overly complicated terminology, this phrase is clear, concise, and universally understood among amateur radio operators."
  - text: "What is your 10-20?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "10-codes are specific to CB radio and emergency services, not amateur radio. While '10-20' means 'location' in CB radio parlance, using these codes on amateur radio frequencies is considered unprofessional and inappropriate. Amateur radio emphasizes clear, direct communication using plain language, and 10-codes are specifically discouraged in the amateur radio community."
  - text: "Locations are not normally broadcast over the radio"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is incorrect. Location information is frequently and appropriately shared on amateur radio repeaters, especially during emergency communications, nets, and general conversations. Operators often share their city, county, or geographic region as part of standard communication practices, particularly when establishing contact or providing context for a conversation."
  - text: "What is your 10-85?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is an invalid CB radio code that does not exist. Additionally, even if it were a real code, it would be inappropriate for amateur radio communications. Amateur radio operators are expected to use clear, direct language rather than cryptic codes borrowed from other radio services. The proper approach is to simply ask 'Where are you?' in plain language."

## The Concept: Clear Communication in Amateur Radio

Amateur radio communication is fundamentally about clear, direct, and professional information exchange. Unlike CB radio, which relies heavily on coded language and abbreviations, amateur radio emphasizes plain speech that can be easily understood by all listeners.

When you want to know someone's location on a repeater, the most appropriate method is simply to ask "Where are you?" This approach follows several key principles of amateur radio communication:
- **Clarity**: The question is immediately understood by all listeners
- **Professionalism**: It avoids slang or borrowed codes from other radio services
- **Inclusivity**: New operators and experienced hams alike can immediately comprehend the question

### Why Plain Language Matters

Amateur radio operators come from diverse backgrounds and skill levels. Using clear, straightforward language ensures that communication remains accessible, especially during emergency communications or when international operators might be involved.

### ❌ Inappropriate Location Inquiries:
- **"What's your 10-20?"**: CB radio code, not used in amateur radio
- **"Give me your grid square"**: Too technical for casual conversation
- **"State your coordinates"**: Overly formal and unnecessarily complex

## Practical Applications

### For Repeater Users:
1. **Casual Conversations**: Use simple, direct language when asking about location
2. **Emergency Communications**: Clear location information can be critical for coordinating assistance
3. **Net Operations**: Consistent, clear communication helps manage group activities efficiently

### For Different Operating Scenarios:
1. **Local Nets**: Sharing location helps context and community building
2. **Mobile Operations**: Location can indicate potential signal paths or propagation conditions
3. **Emergency Preparedness**: Precise location information aids potential rescue or support operations

### Memory Aid:
**K.I.S.S.**: **K**eep **I**t **S**imple and **S**traightforward - just ask "Where are you?"
