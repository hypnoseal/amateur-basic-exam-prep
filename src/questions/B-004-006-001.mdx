question: "On resistors with four colour bands, which colour band specifies the tolerance?"
answers:
  - text: "Fourth"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a four-band resistor color code, the fourth (last) band represents the tolerance, which indicates the precision or acceptable range of variation in the resistor's actual resistance value compared to its nominal rating. This tells you how close the actual resistance will be to the stated value, which is crucial for designing reliable electronic circuits where precise resistance is important."
  - text: "Third"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The third band in a four-band resistor color code typically represents the multiplier that helps calculate the final resistance value, not the tolerance. Placing tolerance in the third position would disrupt the standard color-coding system used globally in electronic components."
  - text: "Second"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The second band in a four-band resistor color code represents the second digit of the resistance value. It is part of the numerical representation of the resistor's resistance, not its tolerance specification. Placing tolerance here would interfere with the standard method of encoding resistance values."
  - text: "First"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The first band in a four-band resistor color code represents the first significant digit of the resistance value. It is the initial part of encoding the numerical resistance, and placing tolerance here would fundamentally break the established color-coding system used in electronic components."

# Understanding Resistor Color Codes: The Fourth Band Tolerance

## Learning Objectives

## The Concept: Resistor Color Code Fundamentals

Resistor color codes are a standardized method of representing resistance values and tolerances using colored bands painted on the body of the resistor. This system allows electronic technicians and engineers to quickly identify a resistor's characteristics without needing to measure it directly.

In a standard four-band resistor, the first two bands represent significant digits, the third band is a multiplier, and the fourth band indicates tolerance. The placement of tolerance on the fourth band allows for a consistent, logical encoding of resistance information that can be read quickly and accurately.

### Why Tolerance Matters

Tolerance tells you how close a resistor's actual resistance will be to its nominal value. For example, a 1000 Ω (1 kΩ) resistor with a ±5% tolerance means the actual resistance could be anywhere between 950 Ω and 1050 Ω. This variation is crucial in designing circuits where precise resistance is important.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Four-Band Resistor Color Code Interpretation:
- **Red-Violet-Black-Gold**: 27 Ω ± 5% tolerance
- **Brown-Black-Red-Silver**: 1 kΩ ± 10% tolerance
- **Green-Blue-Orange-Bronze**: 563 kΩ ± 1% tolerance

### ❌ Incorrect Color Code Placements:
- Placing tolerance in the first band would prevent reading the resistance value
- Using the second band for tolerance would disrupt the numerical encoding
- Moving tolerance to the third band would interfere with the multiplier calculation

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Circuit Design:
1. **Component Selection**: Choose resistors with appropriate tolerance for your specific application
2. **Precision Requirements**: High-precision circuits (like measurement equipment) need tighter tolerance resistors
3. **Cost Considerations**: Lower tolerance resistors are typically less expensive

### For Amateur Radio Equipment:
1. **Bias Networks**: Precise resistance values are crucial in creating stable transistor biasing
2. **Filter Designs**: Accurate resistor values ensure proper frequency response
3. **Measurement Circuits**: Low-tolerance resistors improve measurement accuracy

### Memory Aid:
"**F**ourth **B**and **T**ells **T**olerance" - Remember that the Fourth Band indicates Tolerance.
