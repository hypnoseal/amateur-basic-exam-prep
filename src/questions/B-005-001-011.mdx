question: "How many millihenries equal 10 000 microhenries?"
answers:
  - text: "10 millihenries"
    correct: true
    explanation: "10,000 microhenries converts directly to 10 millihenries. This is because 1 millihenry (mH) equals 1,000 microhenries (µH). So when you have 10,000 µH, dividing by 1,000 gives you 10 mH. The conversion relies on understanding the metric prefix relationships and moving the decimal point appropriately."
  - text: "100 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect because it represents 100,000 microhenries, which is ten times larger than the original value of 10,000 microhenries. To convert from microhenries to millihenries, you divide by 1,000, not multiply."
  - text: "1 millihenry"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer represents only 1,000 microhenries, which is too small compared to the original 10,000 microhenries. By dividing 10,000 µH by 1,000, you arrive at 10 mH, not 1 mH."
  - text: "1000 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect because it represents 1,000,000 microhenries, which is 100 times larger than the original 10,000 microhenries. The correct conversion is 10,000 µH ÷ 1,000 = 10 mH."

# Understanding Inductance Conversions: Microhenries to Millihenries

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

## The Concept: Metric Prefix Conversions in Inductance

Inductance is measured in henries (H), with common subdivisions including microhenries (µH) and millihenries (mH). These units represent different scales of the same fundamental measurement, allowing engineers and amateur radio operators to work with inductance values across a wide range of magnitudes.

The key to understanding these conversions is recognizing the metric prefix relationships. In the metric system, each prefix represents a specific multiplication or division factor. For inductance:
- 1 millihenry (mH) = 1,000 microhenries (µH)
- 1 microhenry (µH) = 0.001 millihenries (mH)

### Why Conversion Skills Matter

In amateur radio, inductance appears in many critical components like:
- Antenna loading coils
- RF chokes
- Transformers
- Filter circuits

Being able to quickly convert between these units helps you understand component specifications, design circuits, and troubleshoot equipment.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Conversion Techniques:
- **10,000 µH → 10 mH**: Divide by 1,000
- **500 µH → 0.5 mH**: Divide by 1,000
- **2,500 µH → 2.5 mH**: Divide by 1,000

### ❌ Common Conversion Mistakes:
- **Multiplying instead of dividing**
- **Forgetting to move the decimal point**
- **Confusing prefix relationships**
