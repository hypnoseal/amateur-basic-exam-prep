question: "You connect four 100-ohm resistors in parallel across a 12-volt battery. How many milliamperes of current are drawn from the battery?"
answers:
  - text: "480 mA"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in parallel, the total current is the sum of the individual branch currents. Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), each 100-ohm resistor will draw 12V/100Ω = 0.12A or 120 mA. With four identical parallel resistors, the total current will be 4 × 120 mA = 480 mA drawn from the battery."
  - text: "48 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation incorrectly assumes the current is divided by the number of resistors, which is not how parallel circuits work. In a parallel circuit, each resistor receives the full circuit voltage and draws current independently."
  - text: "120 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This represents the current through a single resistor, not the total current drawn from the battery when four resistors are connected in parallel. The total current is the sum of all branch currents."
  - text: "240 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is half the correct total current. The calculation fails to account for the full current contribution of all four parallel resistors."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance and Current Flow

In a parallel circuit, each resistor receives the full voltage of the source while drawing its own individual current. Unlike series circuits where current remains constant, parallel circuits allow each branch to draw current independently. The total current drawn from the source is the sum of the individual branch currents.

Ohm's Law (I = V/R) is the key to understanding parallel current flow. In this scenario, each 100-ohm resistor will experience the full 12 volts, allowing us to calculate the current through each branch separately before summing them.

### Parallel Circuit Principles

The fundamental rules of parallel circuits include:
- All components share the same voltage
- Total current equals the sum of individual branch currents
- Each resistor draws current proportional to its resistance
- Adding parallel resistors reduces the total circuit resistance

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Parallel Current Calculations:
- **Four 100Ω Resistors**: 12V ÷ 100Ω = 0.12A per branch, totaling 0.48A (480 mA)
- **Two 50Ω Resistors**: 12V ÷ 50Ω = 0.24A per branch, totaling 0.48A (480 mA)
- **Mixed Resistance Branches**: Each branch calculated individually, then summed

### ❌ Common Parallel Circuit Misconceptions:
- **Dividing Voltage**: Incorrectly assuming voltage is divided among branches
- **Constant Current**: Thinking current remains the same in all branches
- **Simple Averaging**: Attempting to calculate total current by averaging branch currents
