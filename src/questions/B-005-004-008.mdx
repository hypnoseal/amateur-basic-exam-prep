question: "A 30-ohm resistor is connected across a 6-volt battery. What current does it draw?"
answers:
  - text: "0.2 amperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), we calculate the current by dividing the voltage (6 volts) by the resistance (30 ohms). This results in 6V ÷ 30Ω = 0.2A (200 milliamperes). The calculation demonstrates how the current in a simple electrical circuit is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance."
  - text: "2 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer would be incorrect. If 2 amperes were flowing through a 30-ohm resistor, it would require a voltage of 2A × 30Ω = 60 volts, which is not the case in this circuit with only a 6-volt battery."
  - text: "0.5 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Calculating 6V ÷ 30Ω shows that the actual current is 0.2A, not 0.5A. The incorrect value would require a different combination of voltage and resistance."
  - text: "0.005 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect. It represents a much lower current than what would actually flow in this circuit. The 6-volt battery and 30-ohm resistor would produce a current of 0.2A, not 0.005A (5 milliamperes)."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Circuit Calculations

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The basic formula is: **I = V/R**, which means current equals voltage divided by resistance.

In electrical circuits, this law helps us understand how electrical energy flows. Think of electricity like water flowing through a pipe: voltage is the water pressure, resistance is the pipe's narrowness, and current is the amount of water flowing through the pipe. A higher voltage or lower resistance will increase the current, while a lower voltage or higher resistance will decrease it.

### The Mathematical Relationship

The formula I = V/R allows us to calculate any of three values if we know the other two:
- Current (I) = Voltage (V) ÷ Resistance (R)
- Voltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R)
- Resistance (R) = Voltage (V) ÷ Current (I)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Circuit Calculations:
- **6V Battery, 30Ω Resistor**: 6V ÷ 30Ω = 0.2A (exactly our exam question)
- **12V Battery, 60Ω Resistor**: 12V ÷ 60Ω = 0.2A
- **3V Battery, 15Ω Resistor**: 3V ÷ 15Ω = 0.2A

### ❌ Incorrect Calculation Scenarios:
- **Forgetting to Divide**: Multiplying voltage and resistance instead of dividing
- **Ignoring Units**: Not paying attention to volts, ohms, and amperes
- **Miscalculating Decimal Places**: Shifting decimal points incorrectly
