question: "Which of these combinations of resistors could make up a 50-ohm dummy load capable of safely dissipating 5 watts?"
answers:
  - text: "Four 2-watt 200-ohm resistors in parallel"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This combination creates a 50-ohm dummy load with 8 watts total power dissipation capacity. When four 200-ohm resistors are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance becomes 50 ohms (200 ÷ 4 = 50). Each resistor is rated at 2 watts, so four of them provide a total power handling of 8 watts, which safely exceeds the 5-watt requirement."
  - text: "Two 5-watt 100-ohm resistors in series"
    correct: false
    explanation: "When two 100-ohm resistors are connected in series, the total resistance becomes 200 ohms, not 50 ohms. Additionally, while the total power rating would be 10 watts, the configuration does not meet the 50-ohm impedance requirement for a dummy load."
  - text: "Two 2-watt 25-ohm resistors in series"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Connecting two 25-ohm resistors in series creates a 50-ohm total resistance, but the total power dissipation would only be 4 watts (2 watts per resistor), which is insufficient for a 5-watt dummy load."
  - text: "Ten quarter-watt 500-ohm resistors in parallel"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While parallel connection would reduce the total resistance, ten 500-ohm resistors in parallel would create a 50-ohm equivalent resistance, the total power dissipation would only be 2.5 watts (0.25 watts × 10), which is below the 5-watt requirement."

## The Concept: Dummy Load Fundamentals

A **dummy load** is a critical piece of equipment in amateur radio that allows operators to test transmitters without radiating a signal. It provides a safe, consistent electrical load that mimics an antenna while preventing interference and protecting sensitive radio equipment.

The key parameters for a dummy load are:
- **Total Resistance**: Typically 50 ohms to match standard radio transmission systems
- **Power Handling Capacity**: Sufficient to absorb the full output power of the transmitter
- **Uniform Heat Dissipation**: Preventing localized hot spots that could damage components

### Parallel and Series Resistor Configurations

When designing a dummy load, you can combine resistors in different ways to achieve specific resistance and power handling goals:

- **Parallel Connection**: Reduces total resistance, distributes power across multiple components
- **Series Connection**: Increases total resistance, limits current flow
- **Power Handling**: Total power capacity equals the sum of individual resistor ratings

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Successful Dummy Load Designs:
- **Four 200-ohm Resistors in Parallel**: Creates 50-ohm, 8-watt load
- **Five 10-watt 10-ohm Resistors in Parallel**: Creates robust 2-ohm, 50-watt load
- **Ten 1-watt 500-ohm Resistors in Parallel**: Creates precision 50-ohm, 10-watt load

### ❌ Ineffective Dummy Load Configurations:
- **Mismatched Resistance**: Configurations that don't achieve 50-ohm equivalent
- **Insufficient Power Rating**: Total power handling below transmitter output
- **Uneven Heat Distribution**: Resistors with significantly different power ratings

## Practical Applications

### For Transmitter Testing:
1. **Verify Power Output**: Use dummy load to measure transmitter performance without RF radiation
2. **Prevent Interference**: Test equipment without risking signal spillover to nearby frequencies
3. **Protect Sensitive Equipment**: Provide consistent, predictable load for calibration

### Resistor Selection Criteria:
1. **Power Rating**: Choose resistors rated above expected power output
2. **Tolerance**: Use resistors with tight tolerance (1-5%) for consistent performance
3. **Temperature Coefficient**: Select resistors with low temperature sensitivity

### Memory Aid:
"**P**arallel **P**owers, **S**eries **S**izes" - Parallel connections distribute power, series connections manage size and resistance.
