question: "A television receiver suffers interference on channel 5 (76 MHz - 82 MHz) only when you transmit on 14 MHz. From your home you see the tower of a commercial FM station known to broadcast on 92.5 MHz. Which of these solutions would you try first?"
answers:
  - text: "Insert a high-pass filter at the television receiver"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A high-pass filter at the television receiver is the most direct solution to eliminate the interference. Since the interference occurs when transmitting on 14 MHz, a high-pass filter will block the lower frequency harmonics that are causing problems in the TV's channel 5 band while allowing the desired TV signals (76-82 MHz) to pass through. This approach addresses the specific interference without modifying the amateur radio transmission."
  - text: "Insert a low-pass filter at the HF transmitter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While a low-pass filter at the transmitter can help reduce harmonics, it doesn't specifically target the interference affecting channel 5. Low-pass filters are designed to block higher frequencies, but in this case, the problem is caused by lower-frequency harmonics reaching the TV receiver. This solution would be less effective and less precise than a high-pass filter at the receiver."
  - text: "Insert a high-pass filter at the HF transmitter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A high-pass filter at the transmitter would not solve the interference problem. This type of filter would block frequencies lower than the transmitter's operating frequency, which doesn't address the harmonics causing interference in the TV's channel 5 band. The most effective solution is to filter at the receiver's end."
  - text: "Insert a low-pass filter at the television receiver"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A low-pass filter at the TV receiver would block frequencies above the TV channel's range, which is not the issue in this scenario. The interference is caused by lower-frequency harmonics from the 14 MHz amateur radio transmission, so a low-pass filter would not effectively eliminate the problem. A high-pass filter is the more appropriate solution."

## The Concept: Harmonics and Interference Mitigation

Harmonic interference occurs when a radio transmitter generates unwanted signals at frequencies that are multiples of its fundamental operating frequency. In amateur radio, these harmonics can unexpectedly interact with other electronic devices, causing disruption to television, radio, and other communication systems.

When you transmit on 14 MHz (20-meter amateur band), your signal can produce harmonics that fall within the frequency range of television channels. These harmonics are typically lower-order multiples of your fundamental frequency that can directly interfere with TV reception, creating noise, ghosting, or complete signal disruption.

### Understanding Filter Types

Different filters serve different purposes in managing radio frequency signals:
- **High-Pass Filters**: Block frequencies below a certain point, allowing higher frequencies to pass
- **Low-Pass Filters**: Block frequencies above a certain point, allowing lower frequencies to pass
- **Band-Pass Filters**: Allow only a specific range of frequencies to pass

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Effective Interference Solutions:
- **High-Pass at Receiver**: Precisely blocks troublesome lower-frequency harmonics
- **Professional RFI Mitigation**: Targeted filtering that preserves signal integrity
- **Minimal Equipment Modification**: Quick, cost-effective solution

### ❌ Ineffective Interference Approaches:
- **Blanket Filtering**: Applying filters without understanding specific interference characteristics
- **Modifying Transmitter Only**: Failing to address the specific reception problem
- **Ignoring Harmonic Interactions**: Not considering the precise frequency relationships
