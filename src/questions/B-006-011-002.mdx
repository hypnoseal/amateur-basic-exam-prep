question: "What is the approximate length of the driven element of a Yagi antenna for 14.0 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "10.21 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This length represents approximately 0.95 times the wavelength for the 20-meter amateur radio band. The driven element's length is calculated by dividing the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) by the frequency (14.0 MHz) and multiplying by a factor that accounts for the velocity factor of the antenna design. The result is typically slightly shorter than a full wavelength due to end effects and practical antenna construction considerations."
  - text: "5.09 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is approximately half the correct driven element length for a 14.0 MHz Yagi. While antenna elements are often shorter than a full wavelength, this measurement is too short to provide effective radiation and matching characteristics for a 20-meter band Yagi antenna."
  - text: "10.71 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is slightly longer than the optimal driven element length for a 14.0 MHz Yagi. While close to the correct dimension, it would result in less efficient antenna performance and potentially poor impedance matching at the design frequency."
  - text: "21.43 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is approximately double the correct driven element length for a 14.0 MHz Yagi. Such an excessive length would create significant impedance mismatches, reduce antenna efficiency, and make the antenna physically impractical for most amateur radio installations."

## The Concept: Antenna Element Wavelength Fundamentals

A Yagi antenna is a directional antenna consisting of multiple elements, with the driven element being the most critical component that receives or transmits radio signals. The length of the driven element is closely related to the wavelength of the operating frequency, which is determined by dividing the speed of light by the frequency.

For the 20-meter amateur radio band (14.0 MHz), the wavelength calculation follows a simple principle: wavelength = speed of light / frequency. However, the actual driven element length is typically slightly shorter than a full wavelength due to several important factors:
- End effects
- Antenna construction materials
- Velocity factor of the antenna design
- Practical implementation considerations

### The Physics of Antenna Length

Radio waves travel at the speed of light (300,000,000 meters per second). At 14.0 MHz, a full wavelength would be approximately 21.43 meters. However, the driven element is typically around 95% of this theoretical full wavelength, resulting in the 10.21-meter length specified in the correct answer.
