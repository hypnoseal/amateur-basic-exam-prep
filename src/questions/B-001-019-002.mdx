question: "Which of the following emission modes requires that an amateur radio station have means to prevent or indicate overmodulation?"
answers:
  - text: "SSB"
    correct: true
    explanation: "SSB (Single Sideband) requires overmodulation prevention because its linear nature makes it particularly susceptible to distortion. Unlike FM or CW, SSB uses amplitude modulation where voice peaks can cause significant signal degradation if the audio input exceeds the transmitter's linear range. Overmodulation in SSB creates splatter, increases occupied bandwidth, and can cause interference to adjacent frequencies."
  - text: "CW"
    correct: false
    explanation: "CW (Continuous Wave) uses on-off keying of a carrier wave and does not involve amplitude modulation. Since CW transmission is essentially a simple carrier wave being switched on and off by the telegraph key, there's no modulation process that can be 'overmodulated' in the same way as voice modes like SSB."
  - text: "RTTY"
    correct: false
    explanation: "RTTY (Radio Teletype) uses frequency-shift keying, where two different audio frequencies represent digital mark and space states. Unlike SSB, RTTY doesn't have an analog modulation process that can be overmodulated in the traditional sense, so it doesn't require the same type of overmodulation prevention mechanisms."
  - text: "FM"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FM (Frequency Modulation) uses frequency deviation rather than amplitude modulation. While FM can experience deviation limits, its inherent design with a constant carrier amplitude means it doesn't suffer from the same overmodulation issues as SSB. FM transmitters typically have built-in deviation limiters that prevent excessive frequency swing."

## The Concept: SSB Modulation and Signal Linearity

Single Sideband (SSB) is a form of amplitude modulation where a single sideband of the traditional double-sideband AM signal is transmitted, along with a suppressed carrier. This mode offers significant advantages in spectral efficiency and transmitter power usage, but it requires precise audio input management to maintain signal quality.

Overmodulation occurs when the audio input signal exceeds the transmitter's linear amplification range, causing distortion of the RF signal. In SSB, this means the voice peaks become compressed, clipped, or distorted, which dramatically increases the occupied bandwidth and can create interference with adjacent frequencies.

### The Physics of SSB Modulation

Unlike frequency modulation modes, SSB relies on maintaining a linear relationship between audio input and RF output. Think of it like stretching a rubber band - if you stretch too far, it deforms and loses its original shape. Similarly, SSB signals become "deformed" when overmodulated, spreading unwanted energy across the spectrum.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper SSB Modulation Practices:
- **Microphone Technique**: Speaking at a consistent, moderate volume to prevent signal peaks
- **Compression Management**: Using speech compression judiciously to maintain signal intelligibility
- **Audio Processing**: Employing audio equalizers and compressors to manage frequency response

### ❌ Overmodulation Scenarios:
- **Shouting into Microphone**: Causes signal clipping and bandwidth expansion
- **Uncontrolled Audio Gain**: Pushing transmitter audio gain too high
- **Improper Microphone Placement**: Causing inconsistent audio levels
