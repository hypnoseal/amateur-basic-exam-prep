question: "With a digital communication mode based on a computer sound card, what is the result of feeding excessive audio into the transmitter?"
answers:
  - text: "Splatter or out-of-channel emissions"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Excessive audio input causes the digital signal to become overmodulated, which results in signal distortion that spreads beyond the intended frequency channel. This 'splatter' creates unwanted emissions that can interfere with nearby frequencies, violating amateur radio spectrum discipline and potentially causing harmful interference to other communications."
  - text: "Higher signal-to-noise ratio"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Increasing audio input actually degrades the signal-to-noise ratio by introducing distortion and creating unwanted spectral emissions. Proper digital mode operation requires carefully matched audio levels to maintain signal clarity and minimize interference."
  - text: "Lower error rate"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Excessive audio input causes signal distortion that increases error rates in digital communications. Overmodulation introduces additional noise and signal artifacts that make accurate data transmission more difficult, not less."
  - text: "Power amplifier overheating"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While excessive input can stress transmitter components, the primary immediate result of over-driving a digital mode sound card interface is spectral splatter, not power amplifier thermal issues. Overheating is a secondary concern compared to the immediate signal distortion."

# Digital Mode Audio Management: Preventing Spectral Splatter

## The Concept: Digital Mode Signal Generation

Digital communication modes like PSK31, RTTY, and FT8 use computer sound card interfaces to convert audio signals into radio frequency signals. Unlike traditional voice modes, these digital modes rely on precise audio level control to maintain signal integrity and spectral purity.

When audio input is too high, the digital-to-analog conversion becomes distorted, causing the radio signal to spread beyond its intended bandwidth. This phenomenon, known as "splatter" or "out-of-channel emissions," represents a violation of amateur radio operating principles and can cause interference to other communications.

### The Sound Card as a Signal Translator

Think of your sound card interface like a precise translator. Just as a poor translator might add extra words or change meaning, an over-driven sound card introduces unwanted signal variations that spread beyond the intended communication channel.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Digital Mode Audio Levels:
- **Carefully Adjusted Levels**: Keeping audio input at manufacturer-recommended levels
- **Clean Spectral Display**: Narrow, well-defined signal on waterfall displays
- **Minimal Adjacent Channel Interference**: Signals contained within allocated bandwidth

### ❌ Consequences of Excessive Audio Input:
- **Spectral Splatter**: Wide, fuzzy signal edges interfering with nearby frequencies
- **Distorted Constellation Patterns**: Irregular signal shapes on digital mode displays
- **Potential Regulatory Violations**: Emissions outside authorized bandwidths

## Practical Applications

### For Digital Mode Operators:
1. **Use Software Tools**: Most digital mode programs include input level meters
2. **Start Low, Adjust Gradually**: Begin with very low audio levels and incrementally increase
3. **Monitor Spectral Display**: Watch waterfall and constellation displays for distortion signs

### For Different Digital Modes:
1. **PSK31**: Extremely sensitive to audio level variations
2. **FT8**: Requires precise, consistent audio levels
3. **RTTY**: Needs careful carrier deviation management

### Memory Aid:
"**L**ow **A**udio, **C**lear **S**ignal" (LACS) - Keep audio levels low for clean digital communications
