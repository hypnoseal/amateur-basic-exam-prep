question: "What is the most likely cause of erratic readings on an SWR meter?"
answers:
  - text: "Intermittent connection in the antenna system"
    correct: true
    explanation: "An intermittent connection creates unpredictable electrical paths that disrupt signal transmission and cause inconsistent SWR measurements. This could be due to loose connectors, corroded connections, damaged coaxial cable, or mechanical stress points in the antenna system that create momentary breaks in electrical continuity. Such intermittent faults produce random, unstable SWR readings that jump unexpectedly when the connection temporarily changes."
  - text: "Transmitting into the wrong antenna"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Using the wrong antenna would typically produce a consistently high or mismatched SWR, not erratic readings. While an incorrect antenna can cause high SWR, the readings would be stable rather than intermittent. Erratic readings specifically suggest an unstable connection rather than simply the wrong antenna type."
  - text: "Interference from electrical power lines"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power line interference might cause noise on receive or create static, but it doesn't directly cause erratic SWR meter readings. SWR is an electrical measurement of impedance match, which would not be randomly altered by external electromagnetic interference from power lines."
  - text: "Lack of a balun at the antenna feed point"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A missing balun can cause impedance mismatches and potentially higher SWR, but it would produce consistent (not erratic) SWR readings. A balun ensures proper impedance transformation between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines, but its absence wouldn't create random, fluctuating meter readings."

## The Concept: Antenna System Electrical Continuity

Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) is a critical measurement in amateur radio that indicates how efficiently radio frequency energy is transferred from the transmitter to the antenna. A stable, low SWR suggests an excellent match between transmission line and antenna, while erratic readings reveal underlying system problems.

An intermittent connection creates unpredictable electrical paths that disrupt signal transmission. Think of it like a garden hose with a loose connection - sometimes water flows smoothly, sometimes it spurts and sputters. In radio systems, these momentary breaks can cause significant performance issues and potentially damage equipment.

### Common Sources of Intermittent Connections

Intermittent connections can occur in multiple locations:
- Coaxial cable connectors
- Antenna mounting points
- Feed line junction boxes
- Corroded or oxidized metal connections
- Mechanical stress points in the antenna system

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Signs of Intermittent Antenna Connections:
- **SWR meter readings that fluctuate randomly**
- **Sudden changes in signal strength**
- **Occasional transmission difficulties**
- **Crackling or popping sounds during transmission**

### ❌ Stable Issues That Don't Cause Erratic Readings:
- **Consistently high SWR from wrong antenna**
- **External electromagnetic interference**
- **Missing balun with consistent impedance mismatch**

## Practical Applications

### For Antenna System Diagnosis:
1. **Visual Inspection**: Check all connectors for corrosion, looseness, or mechanical damage
2. **Wiggle Test**: Gently move cables and connections while monitoring SWR to identify loose points
3. **Seasonal Maintenance**: Inspect connections more frequently in environments with temperature extremes or high humidity

### Troubleshooting Techniques:
1. **Use a Continuity Meter**: Check electrical paths for consistent connectivity
2. **Clean Connections**: Use contact cleaner and dielectric grease on connectors
3. **Replace Suspect Components**: Swap out cables or connectors that show signs of wear
