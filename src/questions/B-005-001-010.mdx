question: "How can a frequency in megahertz be stated in gigahertz?"
answers:
  - text: "Divide by 1 000"
    correct: true
    explanation: "To convert a frequency from megahertz (MHz) to gigahertz (GHz), you divide the numeric value by 1,000. This follows the standard metric system conversion between adjacent units, where 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. For example, 2,500 MHz would be expressed as 2.5 GHz by dividing 2,500 by 1,000."
  - text: "Multiply by 1 000"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Multiplying by 1,000 would incorrectly increase the frequency value, which is the opposite of converting from MHz to GHz. This method would result in a much larger number and an incorrect representation of the original frequency."
  - text: "Divide by 1 000 000"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Dividing by 1,000,000 would create an unnecessarily small number, reducing the frequency value far more than required for conversion between MHz and GHz. This would incorrectly represent the original frequency."
  - text: "Multiply by 1 000 000"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Multiplying by 1,000,000 would dramatically increase the frequency value, creating a massive and incorrect number that does not represent the original frequency in GHz."

## The Concept: Metric Prefix Conversions in Frequency Measurement

Frequency measurements in amateur radio often require converting between different metric units, with megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) being particularly common. The metric system uses a standardized prefix system where each step represents a thousandfold change.

In the metric hierarchy, **1 GHz = 1,000 MHz**. This means when converting from MHz to GHz, you simply divide the numeric value by 1,000. This follows the fundamental principle of metric conversions: moving "up" the prefix ladder requires dividing by 1,000, while moving "down" requires multiplying by 1,000.

### Why Precise Conversions Matter

Accurate frequency conversions are crucial in amateur radio for:
- Precise frequency logging
- Equipment configuration
- Band planning
- Interference analysis
- Compliance with regulatory frequency allocations

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Frequency Conversions:
- **2,500 MHz = 2.5 GHz**: Divide 2,500 by 1,000
- **1,250 MHz = 1.25 GHz**: Divide 1,250 by 1,000
- **750 MHz = 0.75 GHz**: Divide 750 by 1,000

### ❌ Incorrect Conversion Attempts:
- **2,500 MHz ≠ 2,500,000 GHz**: Multiplying would create an absurdly large number
- **2,500 MHz ≠ 0.0025 GHz**: Dividing by 1,000,000 would make the frequency too small

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Frequency Logging**: Consistently use the most appropriate unit for readability
2. **Equipment Specifications**: Understand how manufacturers list frequency ranges
3. **Band Planning**: Convert between MHz and GHz when discussing different frequency bands

### For Technical Communications:
1. **Signal Analysis**: Use consistent units when discussing propagation characteristics
2. **Contest Logging**: Maintain precision in frequency reporting
3. **Emergency Communications**: Clear, standardized frequency communication

### Memory Aid:
"**M**ove **G**ently **D**own" - **M**Hz to **G**Hz requires **D**ividing by 1,000
