question: "What is the result of excessive positive feedback in an amplifier stage?"
answers:
  - text: "Oscillations appear"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When positive feedback exceeds a critical threshold, the amplifier begins to generate self-sustaining electrical oscillations. This occurs because the output signal is fed back to the input in a way that reinforces and amplifies itself, creating a continuous, uncontrolled signal generation that is not part of the original input. Instead of amplifying an external signal, the circuit begins to generate its own signal autonomously."
  - text: "Distortion is minimized"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Excessive positive feedback actually increases signal distortion. As the feedback loop becomes more pronounced, the amplifier's linear response breaks down, causing significant non-linear changes to the original signal shape, amplitude, and frequency characteristics."
  - text: "Frequency response is flattened"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Contrary to this statement, excessive positive feedback dramatically destabilizes the frequency response. Instead of creating a flat, consistent response, it causes wild variations in gain and can lead to frequency-specific oscillations that deviate significantly from the desired linear amplification."
  - text: "Voltage gain is reduced"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Excessive positive feedback initially increases voltage gain before causing complete circuit instability. Rather than reducing gain, it first amplifies the signal beyond control, ultimately leading to uncontrolled oscillations that render the amplifier non-functional."

## The Concept: Feedback in Electronic Amplification

Feedback is a critical mechanism in electronic circuits where a portion of the output signal is returned to the input. This returned signal can either stabilize (negative feedback) or destabilize (positive feedback) the amplifier's performance.

In an amplifier circuit, positive feedback occurs when the returned signal reinforces the original input signal. Imagine a circular process where each cycle of the signal grows larger and larger, like a snowball rolling down a hill and accumulating more mass. When this positive feedback exceeds a critical threshold, the amplifier transitions from controlled amplification to autonomous signal generation—a phenomenon known as oscillation.

### The Physics of Oscillation

Oscillation happens when the gain in the feedback loop becomes greater than 1 (unity gain) and the phase shift of the returned signal is 360 degrees. At this point, the amplifier becomes a signal generator rather than an amplifier, continuously producing a signal without an external input source.
