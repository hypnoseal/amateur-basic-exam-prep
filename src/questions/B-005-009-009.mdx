question: "If you wire two 20-millihenry inductors in parallel, what is the inductance of the combination?"
answers:
  - text: "10 millihenries"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two inductors of equal value are connected in parallel, the total inductance is reduced according to the reciprocal formula. For two identical inductors, the total inductance is calculated by dividing the individual inductor value by the number of inductors. In this case, 20 mH ÷ 2 = 10 mH."
  - text: "40 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly suggests that parallel inductors increase total inductance, which is the opposite of what actually occurs. Parallel inductors reduce the total inductance, following the reciprocal relationship of parallel components."
  - text: "80 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is completely incorrect and would represent a multiplication of inductor values, which does not occur in parallel circuits. Parallel inductors always result in a total inductance less than the individual inductor values."
  - text: "5 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this answer suggests a reduction in inductance, the calculation is incorrect. For two 20 mH inductors in parallel, the correct total inductance is 10 mH, not 5 mH."

## The Concept: Parallel Inductor Calculations

Inductors in parallel follow a similar mathematical principle to resistors in parallel, but with a key difference in how the total inductance is calculated. When inductors are connected in parallel, the total inductance is always less than the smallest individual inductor value.

The formula for calculating parallel inductance is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of individual inductances. For two identical inductors, this simplifies to dividing the individual inductor value by the number of inductors. This means that adding inductors in parallel actually reduces the total inductance of the circuit.

### The Physics Behind Parallel Inductance

Think of inductance like a pipe's resistance to water flow. When you connect multiple pipes (inductors) in parallel, you're creating more paths for the magnetic field to flow, which paradoxically reduces the overall inductance. Each parallel inductor provides an additional route for magnetic flux, effectively reducing the circuit's total inductional resistance.
