question: "What is the approximate length of the driven element of a quad antenna designed for 14.3 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "21.40 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct length for the driven element of a quad antenna designed for the 14.3 MHz band, calculated using the fundamental wavelength formula for antenna design. The calculation involves dividing the speed of light by the frequency and then multiplying by a factor specific to quad antenna geometry, which results in this precise length for optimal performance."
  - text: "10.49 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is too short for a full-wave quad antenna at 14.3 MHz. The incorrect calculation likely results from a misunderstanding of the wavelength formula or incorrect application of antenna design principles."
  - text: "16.36 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is incorrect and would not provide optimal performance for a quad antenna at 14.3 MHz. It represents an imprecise or incorrectly calculated element length that would result in poor antenna efficiency and radiation pattern."
  - text: "5.35 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is far too short for a quad antenna designed for 14.3 MHz. Such a short element would result in extremely poor antenna performance and would not effectively radiate signals in the 20-meter amateur radio band."

## The Concept: Quad Antenna Geometry and Wavelength

A quad antenna is a type of parasitic beam antenna characterized by its square or rectangular loop design, which differs from the more common linear dipole antenna. The **driven element** is the primary radiating element that receives and transmits radio signals, with its length critically dependent on the operating frequency.

The length of an antenna element is fundamentally related to the wavelength of the target frequency. For a full-wave quad antenna, the element length is approximately one wavelength divided by four, accounting for the antenna's unique loop geometry. The calculation involves dividing the speed of light (300,000,000 meters per second) by the frequency and then applying specific design factors.

### Wavelength Calculation Process
1. Calculate wavelength: 300,000,000 m/s ÷ 14,300,000 Hz ≈ 21 meters
2. Adjust for quad antenna geometry: Full wavelength ÷ 4 ≈ 21.40 meters
3. Account for velocity factor and design specifics
