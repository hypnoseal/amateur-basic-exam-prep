question: "What is the impedance at the feed point of a half-wave dipole in free space?"
answers:
  - text: "73 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A half-wave dipole antenna in free space has a theoretical feed point impedance of 73 ohms. This impedance results from the specific electromagnetic interactions at the antenna's resonant length, where the voltage and current distribution creates a near-perfect match between radiation resistance and system impedance. The 73-ohm value is a fundamental characteristic of dipole antenna design, representing the optimum point for power transfer and efficient radiation."
  - text: "52 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "52 ohms is a common impedance for coaxial cable and some modern radio systems, but it does not represent the natural feed point impedance of a half-wave dipole in free space. While matching networks can transform the dipole's impedance to 52 ohms, the intrinsic feed point impedance remains 73 ohms in ideal conditions."
  - text: "300 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "300 ohms is typical of twin-lead or ladder line feedlines, not the feed point impedance of a half-wave dipole. This impedance is used in some antenna matching systems but does not represent the natural impedance of a dipole antenna in free space."
  - text: "450 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "450 ohms is far from the natural feed point impedance of a half-wave dipole. This value is sometimes associated with open-wire transmission lines or specific matching transformers, but it does not represent the inherent impedance characteristics of a half-wave dipole in free space."

## The Concept: Antenna Feed Point Impedance

A half-wave dipole antenna is a fundamental design in amateur radio, consisting of a straight conductor split at its center and fed with a transmission line. The term "half-wave" means the total antenna length is approximately one-half of the wavelength at the operating frequency.

The **feed point impedance** represents the electrical resistance seen by the transmission line where it connects to the antenna. For a half-wave dipole in free space (an ideal, unobstructed environment), this impedance is theoretically 73 ohms. This value emerges from the complex interaction between current distribution, electromagnetic radiation, and the antenna's physical geometry.

### Impedance: More Than Just a Number

Impedance is not just a resistance value, but a complex representation of how an antenna system transfers electrical energy. The 73-ohm figure represents a perfect balance between:
- Radiation resistance (energy converted to radio waves)
- Loss resistance (energy dissipated as heat)
- Reactive components (energy temporarily stored in the antenna's electromagnetic field)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Characteristics of 73-Ohm Dipole Feed Point:
- **Optimal Power Transfer**: Provides near-maximum radiation efficiency
- **Minimal Reflection**: Minimizes standing wave ratio (SWR) when matched correctly
- **Consistent Across Frequency Bands**: Maintains similar impedance characteristics across amateur radio HF bands

### ❌ Impedance Mismatches:
- **52-Ohm Coax Adaptation**: Requires slight impedance transformation
- **300-Ohm Twin-Lead**: Needs specific matching networks
- **Open-Wire Feedlines**: Require more complex matching techniques
