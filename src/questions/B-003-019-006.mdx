question: "Where should the green wire in a three-wire AC line cord be connected in a power supply?"
answers:
  - text: "To the chassis"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The green wire is the ground (earth) wire in a three-wire AC cord, which is designed to provide a safe path for electrical fault currents to dissipate into the equipment's metal chassis. This prevents electrical shock by ensuring that any stray current from a short circuit or component failure is immediately directed to ground, triggering the circuit breaker or fuse and protecting the user from potential electrocution."
  - text: "To the white wire"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The white wire is the neutral wire in AC electrical systems, which completes the circuit by providing the return path for current. It should never be connected to the ground wire, as this would create a dangerous electrical condition that could bypass safety protections and increase shock risk."
  - text: "To the \"hot\" side of the power switch"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Connecting the ground wire to the \"hot\" (live) side of the power switch would completely defeat the safety purpose of the ground wire. This would prevent the ground wire from providing protection when the switch is off and could create a serious electrical hazard that could lead to shock or equipment damage."
  - text: "To the fuse"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The ground wire serves a different function from the fuse. While the fuse protects against overcurrent by breaking the circuit, the ground wire provides a safe path for fault currents to the equipment chassis. Connecting the ground wire to the fuse would not provide proper electrical safety and could compromise the equipment's protective grounding system."

# Electrical Safety in Amateur Radio: Understanding Equipment Grounding

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The purpose and function of the ground wire in electrical systems
- Why proper grounding is critical for equipment safety
- How ground wires prevent electrical shock
- The correct way to connect ground wires in power supplies

## The Concept: Electrical Grounding Fundamentals

Electrical grounding is a critical safety mechanism that provides a low-resistance path for fault currents to safely dissipate, preventing electrical shock and equipment damage. In a three-wire electrical system, the green (or bare) wire is the dedicated ground wire, designed to protect users and equipment from electrical faults.

When working correctly, the ground wire provides a direct path to the equipment's metal chassis, which is then connected to the earth ground at the electrical panel. This creates a "safety valve" that immediately directs any stray electrical current away from the user and into the ground, triggering protective devices like circuit breakers.

### The Physics of Electrical Grounding

Think of the ground wire like a safety drain in a bathtub. If water (electrical current) starts to overflow (electrical fault), the drain (ground wire) quickly and safely removes the excess, preventing damage to the surrounding area (the user and equipment). Without this drain, the "water" would spill everywhere, causing potential harm.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Grounding Practices:
- **Power Supply Chassis Connection**: Green wire connected directly to the metal chassis
- **Radio Equipment Rack**: All equipment chassis bonded together with a common ground
- **Antenna Installations**: Ground rods used to provide a low-resistance path for static and lightning discharge

### ❌ Dangerous Grounding Mistakes:
- **Floating Ground**: No ground connection, leaving equipment vulnerable to shock
- **Improper Ground Wire Routing**: Ground wire connected to non-conductive or high-resistance points
- **Ground Loop Creation**: Multiple ground paths creating unwanted current circulation

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Power Supplies:
1. **Direct Chassis Connection**: Connect the green ground wire directly to the metal chassis using a secure, low-resistance connection
2. **Check Ground Continuity**: Regularly test ground connections with a multimeter
3. **Avoid Paint or Oxide Layers**: Ensure a clean, metal-to-metal connection for effective grounding

### For Station Safety:
1. **Use Ground Straps**: Connect all equipment chassis together
2. **Install Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs)**: Add an extra layer of personal protection
3. **Use Proper Grounding Accessories**: Quality ground lugs, bonding jumpers, and ground rods
