question: "If two equal-value capacitors are connected in series, what is their total capacitance?"
answers:
  - text: "Half the value of either capacitor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two equal-value capacitors are connected in series, their total capacitance is reduced to half the value of a single capacitor. This follows the series capacitance formula 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2. With identical capacitors, this mathematical relationship results in a total capacitance that is exactly half of one capacitor's individual value."
  - text: "Twice the value of one capacitor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because series capacitor connections actually reduce total capacitance, not increase it. Connecting capacitors in series increases the total effective resistance to charge flow, which mathematically results in a lower total capacitance."
  - text: "The value of one capacitor times 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer completely misunderstands capacitor series connections. Multiplying capacitance by 4 would suggest a dramatic increase in total capacitance, which is not how series connections work for capacitors."
  - text: "The value of one capacitor divided by 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While series connections reduce capacitance, dividing by 4 is not the correct mathematical result. With two equal capacitors in series, the total capacitance is halved, not reduced to one-quarter of the original value."

## The Concept: Capacitor Series Connections

Capacitance is a measure of an electrical component's ability to store electrical charge. When capacitors are connected in series, they create a more complex charge storage system where the total capacitance is always less than the smallest individual capacitor's value.

In a series connection, electric charge must flow through each capacitor sequentially. This creates a cumulative resistance to charge storage, effectively reducing the circuit's total capacitance. The mathematical relationship follows the reciprocal formula: 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3...

### Series vs. Parallel Connections

While parallel capacitor connections increase total capacitance by adding individual capacitor values, series connections reduce capacitance. This is analogous to water pipes: series connections create more resistance to flow, while parallel connections provide more pathways.
