question: "What is the frequency range of the 160-metre amateur radio band in Canada?"
answers:
  - text: "1.8 MHz to 2.0 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct frequency allocation for the 160-metre band in Canada, as defined by Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada. The 160-metre band is one of the lowest frequency amateur radio bands, offering unique propagation characteristics and long-distance communication potential during nighttime hours. This specific range allows Canadian amateur radio operators to use frequencies between 1.8 and 2.0 MHz for various communication modes, including SSB, CW, and digital modes."
  - text: "1.5 MHz to 2.0 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This range is incorrect. While it includes part of the correct 160-metre band frequencies, it extends lower than the actual Canadian amateur radio allocation. The true 160-metre band starts at 1.8 MHz, not 1.5 MHz, making this answer technically inaccurate according to ISED regulations."
  - text: "2.0 MHz to 2.25 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range is completely outside the 160-metre amateur radio band. It represents frequencies higher than the allocated amateur radio band, and transmitting on these frequencies would violate Canadian amateur radio regulations and potentially cause interference to other radio services."
  - text: "2.25 MHz to 2.5 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range is entirely outside the 160-metre amateur radio band. Transmitting on these frequencies would be a violation of Canadian amateur radio regulations and could potentially cause harmful interference to other authorized radio services."

# The 160-Metre Band: Exploring Amateur Radio's Lowest High-Frequency Allocation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The precise frequency range of the 160-metre amateur radio band in Canada
- Unique propagation characteristics of low-frequency HF bands
- Regulatory considerations for amateur radio frequency allocations
- Practical applications of the 160-metre band

## The Concept: Low-Frequency Amateur Radio Communications

The 160-metre band represents a unique slice of the radio spectrum, offering amateur radio operators exceptional long-distance communication capabilities, particularly during nighttime hours. Situated at the lowest end of the High Frequency (HF) spectrum, this band provides distinct propagation characteristics that set it apart from higher frequency amateur allocations.

### Frequency Allocation Specifics

In Canada, the 160-metre band is precisely allocated from 1.8 MHz to 2.0 MHz. This narrow 200 kHz window provides amateur radio operators with a challenging but fascinating radio environment. Unlike higher frequency bands that rely primarily on line-of-sight or ionospheric skip, the 160-metre band exhibits remarkable ground wave and near-vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) propagation characteristics.

The band's lower frequency allows signals to follow the Earth's curvature more effectively, making it particularly useful for regional and regional-to-continental communication, especially during nighttime when ionospheric conditions enhance propagation.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Effective 160-Metre Band Applications:
- **Regional Emergency Communications**: Reliable regional communication during nighttime hours
- **Long-Distance CW and Digital Modes**: Exceptional propagation for low-power digital communications
- **Experimental Low-Power Transmission**: Ideal for QRP (low-power) enthusiasts exploring signal propagation

### ❌ Incorrect Band Usage:
- **Transmitting Outside 1.8-2.0 MHz**: Violates Canadian amateur radio regulations
- **Assuming Similar Propagation to Higher Bands**: Each frequency range has unique transmission characteristics
- **Overlooking Nighttime Propagation Advantages**: The 160-metre band performs differently during day and night

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Night-Time Communication**: Leverage unique ground wave and NVIS propagation
2. **Emergency Preparedness**: Practice regional communication techniques
3. **Antenna Experimentation**: Design compact, efficient antennas for challenging low-frequency band

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Antenna Length**: Requires significantly longer antennas compared to higher frequency bands
2. **Power Limitations**: Often used with lower power due to antenna size constraints
3. **Noise Sensitivity**: More susceptible to man-made electrical noise
