question: "What identification, if any, is required when two amateur radio stations end communications?"
answers:
  - text: "Each station must transmit its own call sign"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct procedure according to ISED regulations. Each station must independently identify itself at the end of communication by transmitting its own unique call sign. This requirement ensures clear accountability, helps monitor spectrum usage, and maintains the legal documentation of amateur radio contacts. It's a fundamental part of amateur radio operating protocol that allows for tracking and verification of transmissions."
  - text: "No identification is required"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Canadian amateur radio regulations always require stations to identify themselves during and at the conclusion of communications. Failing to identify is a violation of ISED regulations and can result in license suspension or revocation. Call sign identification is a critical component of responsible amateur radio operation."
  - text: "One of the stations must transmit both stations' call signs"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This procedure is not specified in amateur radio regulations. Each station is individually responsible for its own identification. Requiring one station to identify both parties would create confusion and does not meet the regulatory requirement for personal station identification."
  - text: "Both stations must transmit both call signs"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While both stations must identify, they do not need to transmit each other's call signs. Each station is only required to transmit its own unique call sign. Requiring both stations to transmit both call signs would be redundant and inefficient."

## The Concept: Call Sign Identification in Amateur Radio

Amateur radio is a regulated communication service where each operator is assigned a unique call sign by their national telecommunications authority. This call sign serves multiple purposes: it identifies the specific operator, indicates their geographic region, and provides a legal means of tracking and managing radio spectrum usage.

When two amateur radio stations complete a communication, each station is individually responsible for identifying itself. This isn't just a courtesy—it's a legal requirement enforced by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED). The identification ensures accountability, helps prevent unauthorized transmissions, and maintains the professional standards of amateur radio.

### Why Individual Identification Matters

Unlike other communication services where a single party might handle identification, amateur radio places the responsibility on each individual station. This approach:
- Confirms each station's legal right to transmit
- Creates a clear record of who was communicating
- Prevents unauthorized or unidentified transmissions
- Supports the self-regulating nature of amateur radio

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct End-of-Contact Identification:
- **Station A**: "VE3ABC, clear"
- **Station B**: "VE7XYZ, clear"
- Both stations independently identify themselves before ending the contact

### ❌ Incorrect Contact Closure Methods:
- **No Identification**: Simply stopping transmission without call signs
- **Partial Identification**: Only one station identifying
- **Cross-Identification**: One station trying to identify for both parties

## Practical Applications

### For New Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Always Identify Yourself**: Transmit your call sign at the end of each communication
2. **Be Consistent**: Use standard phonetic spelling if needed
3. **Keep It Brief**: A simple "[Your Call Sign], clear" is sufficient

### For Different Communication Scenarios:
1. **Local Repeater Contacts**: Same identification rules apply
2. **Long-Distance or DX Contacts**: Particularly important to clearly identify
3. **Emergency Communications**: Identification remains crucial even in high-stress situations

### Memory Aid:
"**I**dentify **I**ndividually" - Each station must identify its own call sign at the end of communication.
