question: "The primary winding of a transformer has 250 turns, and the secondary has 500 turns. If the input voltage is 120 volts, what is the secondary voltage?"
answers:
  - text: "240 V"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The secondary voltage is determined by the turns ratio of the transformer. With 500 turns on the secondary compared to 250 turns on the primary, the voltage is doubled. The 120V input multiplied by the ratio of secondary to primary turns (500/250 = 2) results in 240V output, following the fundamental principle of transformer voltage transformation."
  - text: "480 V"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage is incorrectly four times the input voltage. The turns ratio is 2:1, which means the voltage doubles, not quadruples. Calculating 120V × (500/250) results in 240V, not 480V."
  - text: "620 V"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage does not correspond to any logical calculation based on the transformer's turns ratio. It's significantly higher than the input voltage and cannot be derived from the given primary and secondary turn counts."
  - text: "60 V"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage represents halving the input voltage, which is incorrect. With more turns on the secondary than the primary, the voltage increases, not decreases. The correct calculation is 120V × (500/250) = 240V."

## The Concept: Transformer Voltage Transformation

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits through electromagnetic induction. The key principle governing voltage transformation is the **turns ratio** - the relationship between the number of turns in the primary and secondary windings.

The fundamental equation for transformer voltage is: 
**Vsecondary = Vprimary × (Nsecondary / Nprimary)**

Where:
- Vsecondary is the output voltage
- Vprimary is the input voltage
- Nsecondary is the number of turns in the secondary winding
- Nprimary is the number of turns in the primary winding

In this specific example, we have:
- Primary winding: 250 turns
- Secondary winding: 500 turns
- Input voltage: 120V

Calculating the output voltage: 120V × (500/250) = 240V
