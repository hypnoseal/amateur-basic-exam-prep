question: "If you wire two 12-millihenry chokes in series, what is the inductance of the combination?"
answers:
  - text: "24 millihenries"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When inductors are connected in series, their individual inductance values are added together. Since both chokes are 12 millihenries, connecting them in series results in a total inductance of 24 millihenries. This is analogous to connecting batteries in series, where voltage increases, or resistors in series, where resistance increases."
  - text: "6 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would be the result if the inductors were connected in parallel, not series. In a parallel connection, the total inductance would be less than the individual inductor values, following a reciprocal calculation."
  - text: "48 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value would result from quadrupling the original inductor value, which does not occur in series connections. Series inductors simply add their individual values, not multiply them."
  - text: "3 millihenries"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is not the correct calculation for series inductors. Dividing the inductor values would occur in a parallel configuration, not a series configuration."

## The Concept: Series Inductor Connections

Inductors, like chokes, are electrical components that resist changes in current flow and store energy in a magnetic field. When multiple inductors are connected in series, their total inductance is calculated by simply adding their individual inductance values.

This is fundamentally different from how resistance or capacitance behave in series circuits. With inductors, the total inductance increases linearly - each additional inductor contributes its full value to the total circuit inductance.

### The Mathematical Principle

If you have multiple inductors L1, L2, L3, etc., connected in series, the total inductance (LT) is calculated as:
LT = L1 + L2 + L3 + ...

In this specific example, two 12-millihenry chokes connected in series result in a total inductance of 24 millihenries (12 mH + 12 mH).

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Successful Series Inductor Applications:
- **RF Choke Circuits**: Creating high-impedance paths to block unwanted radio frequencies
- **Filter Design**: Building complex electromagnetic filters for noise suppression
- **Impedance Matching**: Adjusting overall circuit inductance for specific radio frequency applications

### ❌ Incorrect Series Inductor Assumptions:
- **Assuming Parallel Behavior**: Mistakenly dividing inductor values when they're in series
- **Ignoring Inductor Ratings**: Not considering individual inductor current and power handling capabilities
- **Overlooking Magnetic Coupling**: Failing to account for potential magnetic interactions between closely spaced inductors

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **RF Filtering**: Creating complex RF choke circuits to suppress unwanted signals
2. **Antenna Impedance Matching**: Using series inductors to adjust antenna system characteristics
3. **Noise Reduction**: Designing circuits that block electromagnetic interference

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Inductor Quality**: Real-world inductors have additional characteristics like series resistance and self-resonance
2. **Frequency Dependence**: Inductor behavior changes with frequency, affecting circuit performance
3. **Magnetic Interactions**: Physically spacing inductors can minimize unintended magnetic coupling

### Memory Aid:
"**S**eries **I**nductors **A**dd" (SIA) - Remember that series inductors always add their full values.
