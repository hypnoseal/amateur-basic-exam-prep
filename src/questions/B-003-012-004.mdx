question: "What is the usual bandwidth of an amateur radio single-sideband signal?"
answers:
  - text: "Between 2 kHz and 3 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Single-sideband (SSB) signals typically occupy a bandwidth between 2 kHz and 3 kHz, which is significantly narrower than traditional AM (Amplitude Modulation) signals. This compact bandwidth allows more efficient use of radio spectrum, improved signal-to-noise ratio, and more simultaneous communications in limited frequency space. The exact bandwidth depends on the audio frequencies transmitted, but speech typically falls within this 2-3 kHz range."
  - text: "1 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A 1 kHz bandwidth is too narrow to effectively carry voice communications. This bandwidth would severely limit the audio quality and intelligibility of the transmitted signal, cutting off important speech frequencies and making communication difficult or impossible."
  - text: "2 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While 2 kHz is at the lower end of the typical SSB bandwidth, it represents a single point rather than the full range. The actual bandwidth varies slightly based on audio content and modulation characteristics, typically spanning from 2 kHz to 3 kHz."
  - text: "Between 3 kHz and 6 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This bandwidth is wider than the standard SSB signal. While some specialized modes might use this range, typical amateur radio SSB voice communications occupy a narrower 2-3 kHz bandwidth to maximize spectral efficiency and minimize interference."

## The Concept: Single-Sideband Modulation and Spectrum Efficiency

Single-sideband (SSB) is a form of amplitude modulation that significantly reduces the bandwidth required for voice communications. Unlike traditional AM, which transmits a carrier wave and both upper and lower sidebands, SSB transmits only one sideband, eliminating the redundant carrier and other sideband.

The human voice typically contains meaningful audio frequencies between approximately 300 Hz and 3 kHz. SSB modulation is designed to capture this range efficiently, creating a compact signal that requires less radio spectrum while maintaining good audio intelligibility. This makes SSB an ideal mode for long-distance and weak-signal communications in amateur radio.

### Technical Breakdown of SSB Bandwidth

When an SSB signal is generated, the modulation process creates a signal with:
- Lower frequency limit: Around 300 Hz
- Upper frequency limit: Around 3 kHz
- Total occupied bandwidth: Between 2 kHz and 3 kHz

This compact bandwidth allows more stations to operate simultaneously in the same frequency range compared to traditional AM transmission methods.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Efficient SSB Signal Characteristics:
- **Voice Communication**: Clearly transmitted speech with minimal spectrum usage
- **DX (Long Distance) Contacts**: Ability to communicate over thousands of kilometers using minimal power
- **Weak Signal Modes**: Better signal-to-noise ratio compared to wider bandwidth modes

### ❌ Bandwidth Problems:
- **Too Narrow**: Losing speech clarity and important audio information
- **Too Wide**: Causing unnecessary interference with neighboring frequencies
- **Improper Filtering**: Generating spurious emissions outside the intended bandwidth
