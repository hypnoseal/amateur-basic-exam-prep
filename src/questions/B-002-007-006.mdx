question: "What is the correct Q code to ask who is calling you?"
answers:
  - text: "QRZ?"
    correct: true
    explanation: "QRZ? is the standard Q-signal used in amateur radio to ask 'Who is calling me?' It is universally recognized among amateur radio operators worldwide as a way to request identification from stations attempting to make contact. When a station hears a call but cannot discern the specific caller's identity, they use QRZ? to prompt the calling station to repeat their call sign."
  - text: "QSL?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QSL? means 'Can you confirm receipt of my transmission?' or 'Do you acknowledge?' It is used to request confirmation of message receipt, not to ask who is calling. Using QSL? in this context would be incorrect and potentially confusing to other operators."
  - text: "QRL?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QRL? means 'Are you busy?' or 'Is this frequency in use?' It is used to check if a frequency is occupied or if an ongoing communication is taking place. While important in amateur radio etiquette, it does not ask who is calling the station."
  - text: "QRT?"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QRT means 'I am shutting down' or 'I am ceasing transmission'. It is used when an operator is ending their radio session, not when trying to identify who is calling. Using QRT? would not make sense in the context of asking for caller identification."

# Understanding Q Codes: QRZ and Station Identification in Amateur Radio

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The purpose and usage of Q codes in amateur radio communication
- The specific meaning of QRZ and how it's used to request caller identification
- The differences between various Q codes and their appropriate contexts
- How Q codes facilitate clear, concise communication across language barriers

## The Concept: Q Codes in Amateur Radio Communication

Q codes are three-letter abbreviations used internationally in radio communication to quickly convey complex ideas or questions. Originating in maritime and telegraph communications, Q codes have become a standard shorthand in amateur radio, allowing operators to communicate efficiently across different languages and skill levels.

Each Q code can function as a question (when followed by a question mark) or as a statement (when used without a question mark). These codes transcend linguistic barriers, making them invaluable in global amateur radio communications. QRZ? is one of the most recognizable Q codes, specifically designed to ask "Who is calling me?"

### The Universal Language of Amateur Radio

By using standardized codes like QRZ?, amateur radio operators can quickly and unambiguously communicate complex ideas. This is especially important during contests, emergency communications, or when operators speak different native languages. The code eliminates the need for lengthy explanations and provides immediate clarity.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Usage of QRZ?:
- **Contest Scenario**: When multiple stations are calling simultaneously, an operator might use QRZ? to clarify which specific station is attempting contact
- **Weak Signal Conditions**: If a station hears partial call signs during poor propagation, QRZ? requests full identification
- **Busy Repeater**: On a crowded repeater, QRZ? helps identify who is initiating a call

### ❌ Inappropriate Q Code Applications:
- **Using QSL? to ask who's calling**: This would confuse other operators expecting a confirmation request
- **Responding to QRZ? with another Q code**: Always respond with your complete call sign when someone uses QRZ?
- **Overusing Q codes in casual conversation**: While useful, Q codes should enhance, not replace, clear communication

## Practical Applications

### For HF and VHF Operations:
1. **Efficient Identification**: Use QRZ? when you hear a partial or unclear call sign
2. **Contest Protocols**: During radio contests, QRZ? helps manage multiple simultaneous callers
3. **DX (Long-Distance) Communications**: Standardized codes like QRZ? help overcome language barriers

### For Different Operating Modes:
1. **SSB Voice**: Clearly pronounce "QRZ?" when seeking caller identification
2. **CW (Morse Code)**: Send "QRZ?" as a standard request for caller information
3. **Digital Modes**: Include QRZ? in text-based communications to request identification

### Memory Aid:
"**Q**uickly **R**ecognize **Z**caller" - QRZ? helps you quickly identify who is calling you.
