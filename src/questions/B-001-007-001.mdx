question: "Which of the following topics is prohibited on an amateur radio club net?"
answers:
  - text: "Business planning"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Business discussions or commercial activities are strictly prohibited on amateur radio nets because the amateur radio service is designed for personal communication, technical experimentation, and public service—not for conducting private business transactions. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Canadian regulations specifically prohibit using amateur radio frequencies for commercial purposes, including business planning, solicitation, or financial transactions."
  - text: "Recreation planning"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Recreation planning is a perfectly acceptable topic for amateur radio club nets. These discussions help club members coordinate social activities, plan group outings, organize field days, or arrange group camping and hiking events related to amateur radio. Such conversations contribute to club cohesion and community building among amateur radio operators."
  - text: "Code practice planning"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Code practice planning is an excellent use of amateur radio net time. Many clubs use net frequencies to organize Morse code training sessions, discuss learning techniques, set up practice schedules, and help new operators improve their skills. This type of educational activity directly supports the amateur radio service's mission of skill development and technical communication."
  - text: "Emergency planning"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Emergency planning is not only allowed but strongly encouraged on amateur radio nets. Amateur radio operators play a critical role in emergency communications, and nets are an ideal forum for discussing preparedness, coordinating potential response strategies, and training for emergency communication scenarios. This aligns with the fundamental public service mission of amateur radio."

## The Concept: Purpose and Limits of Amateur Radio Communication

Amateur radio is a unique communication service with specific legal and ethical guidelines. Unlike commercial radio services, amateur radio is fundamentally about personal communication, technical experimentation, skill development, and public service. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and national regulators like ISED have established clear boundaries to preserve the integrity and purpose of the amateur radio service.

### The Core Principles of Amateur Radio

Amateur radio operators are licensed to:
- Engage in personal communication
- Conduct technical experiments
- Provide emergency communications
- Develop radio communication skills
- Serve their local communities

Critically, these purposes explicitly exclude using amateur radio frequencies for commercial or business-related activities.
