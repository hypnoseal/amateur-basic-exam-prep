question: "The maximum bandwidth of an amateur radio station's transmission allowed in the band 28 MHz to 29.7 MHz is:"
answers:
  - text: "20 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The 20 kHz bandwidth limit is the standard maximum allowable transmission width for amateur radio in the 10-meter band (28-29.7 MHz). This specification ensures efficient spectrum usage, minimizes interference between stations, and complies with ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) regulations for amateur radio frequency management. The bandwidth limit helps maintain orderly and efficient communication across shared amateur radio frequencies."
  - text: "6 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While 6 kHz is a narrow bandwidth suitable for some modes like SSB voice, it is not the specified maximum bandwidth for the 10-meter band. This bandwidth would be too restrictive for some digital modes and modern amateur radio transmission techniques used in the 28-29.7 MHz range."
  - text: "30 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "30 kHz exceeds the maximum allowable bandwidth for this frequency band. Such a wide transmission would potentially cause significant interference with other amateur radio stations and violate ISED spectrum management regulations."
  - text: "15 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "15 kHz is wider than the permitted maximum bandwidth for this frequency band. Transmitting with this bandwidth would create excessive interference and fail to comply with amateur radio frequency usage regulations."

## The Concept: Bandwidth and Spectrum Management

**Bandwidth** in radio communications represents the range of frequencies occupied by a transmission signal. In amateur radio, bandwidth limits are crucial for maintaining efficient spectrum use, preventing interference, and ensuring multiple stations can communicate simultaneously without disrupting each other's signals.

The 10-meter band (28-29.7 MHz) is a versatile high-frequency band used for various communication modes, including voice, digital, and weak-signal communications. The 20 kHz bandwidth limit provides a balanced approach that allows flexible transmission techniques while preventing excessive spectral occupation.

### Bandwidth Implications

Different transmission modes require different bandwidths:
- **SSB Voice**: Typically 2.7-3 kHz
- **Digital Modes**: Can range from 500 Hz to 20 kHz
- **Weak Signal Modes**: Often require very narrow bandwidths
- **Experimental Modes**: May use wider bandwidths within the 20 kHz limit

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Compliant Transmission Methods:
- **SSB Voice**: Uses approximately 3 kHz, well within 20 kHz limit
- **PSK31**: Digital mode using around 31 Hz, highly efficient
- **FT8**: Digital weak-signal mode using approximately 50 Hz
- **RTTY**: Typically 300-500 Hz bandwidth

### ❌ Non-Compliant Transmission Scenarios:
- **Excessively Wide Digital Modes**: Transmissions exceeding 20 kHz
- **Improperly Tuned Transmitters**: Creating unnecessary spectral splatter
- **Misconfigured Amplifiers**: Generating harmonics beyond permitted bandwidth

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Mode Selection**: Choose transmission modes compatible with 20 kHz limit
2. **Equipment Configuration**: Ensure transmitters are properly tuned
3. **Interference Mitigation**: Use narrowest bandwidth practical for your communication needs

### For Different Operating Scenarios:
1. **Contesting**: Optimize signal efficiency within bandwidth constraints
2. **Digital Communications**: Select modes that maximize information transfer
3. **Weak Signal Work**: Utilize narrow-bandwidth techniques

### Memory Aid:
