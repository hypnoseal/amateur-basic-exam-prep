question: "Which of the following has a positive terminal and a negative terminal?"
answers:
  - text: "A battery"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A battery has a positive (+) and negative (-) terminal, which are essential for creating an electrical potential difference (voltage) that allows current to flow in an electrical circuit. These terminals represent the source of electrical energy, where electrons flow from the negative terminal through the external circuit to the positive terminal, creating an electrical current."
  - text: "A potentiometer"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A potentiometer is a variable resistor with three terminals used for adjusting electrical resistance, but it does not inherently have a positive and negative terminal. It has a wiper terminal and two end terminals that can vary resistance, but these are not polarity-specific like battery terminals."
  - text: "A fuse"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A fuse is a safety device designed to protect electrical circuits by breaking the connection when excessive current flows. It has two identical terminals without polarity - current can flow through a fuse in either direction, and it does not have distinct positive and negative terminals."
  - text: "A resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A resistor is a passive electrical component that limits current flow and has resistance. Its terminals are symmetrical and non-polarized, meaning current can flow through a resistor in either direction. Unlike a battery, a resistor does not have inherent positive and negative terminals."

## The Concept: Electrical Terminals and Polarity

Electrical components have different characteristics in terms of their terminals and how current flows through them. Some components, like batteries, have a specific polarity with distinct positive and negative terminals, while others do not.

A **battery** is an electrochemical device that converts stored chemical energy into electrical energy. Its positive and negative terminals are fundamental to its operation, creating a potential difference that drives electrical current through an external circuit. The chemical reactions inside the battery cause electrons to flow from the negative terminal through the circuit to the positive terminal.

### Types of Electrical Component Terminals

Different electrical components have varying terminal characteristics:
- **Polarized Components**: Have specific positive and negative terminals (e.g., batteries, electrolytic capacitors)
- **Non-Polarized Components**: Can have current flow in either direction (e.g., resistors, standard capacitors, fuses)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Components with Positive and Negative Terminals:
- **Batteries**: All types, from AA alkaline to car batteries
- **Electrolytic Capacitors**: Typically used in power supply circuits
- **Solar Cells**: Generate electrical energy with clear polarity
- **Fuel Cells**: Electrochemical devices with distinct terminals

### ❌ Components Without Polarity:
- **Resistors**: Symmetrical current flow
- **Mechanical Switches**: No inherent polarity
- **Standard Capacitors**: Can be connected in either direction
- **Fuses**: Protect circuits without directional requirements
