question: "Why isn't FM used as an amateur radio emission mode below 28 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "The bandwidth would exceed limits in the regulations"
    correct: true
    explanation: "FM modulation requires significantly wider bandwidth compared to other modes like SSB or CW, particularly at lower frequencies. At HF frequencies below 28 MHz, an FM signal would occupy much more spectrum space than permitted by amateur radio regulations. This excessive bandwidth would cause potential interference with other stations and violate spectral efficiency requirements."
  - text: "The transmitter efficiency for this mode is low"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While FM transmitters can have lower efficiency compared to some other modes, this is not the primary reason FM isn't used below 28 MHz. Transmitter efficiency is more related to the specific design and implementation rather than being an inherent limitation of FM modulation at lower frequencies."
  - text: "Harmonics could not be attenuated to practical levels"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Harmonic attenuation is not the primary constraint preventing FM use below 28 MHz. Modern transmitter design and filtering techniques can effectively manage harmonics across various modulation modes and frequency ranges."
  - text: "The frequency stability would not be adequate"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Modern synthesized transceivers have excellent frequency stability across all HF bands. Frequency stability is not a limiting factor preventing FM use below 28 MHz, and current technology can easily maintain the precise frequency control required for amateur radio operations."

## The Concept: FM Bandwidth and Spectral Efficiency

Frequency Modulation (FM) is a complex modulation technique where the frequency of the carrier signal varies in proportion to the amplitude of the modulating signal. Unlike other modes like Single Sideband (SSB) or Continuous Wave (CW), FM requires significantly more bandwidth to transmit the same amount of information.

At HF frequencies below 28 MHz, an FM signal would occupy a much larger portion of the spectrum compared to more spectrally efficient modes. Amateur radio regulations are designed to maximize the number of stations that can simultaneously use limited frequency allocations, making wide-bandwidth modes impractical in these crowded bands.

### Bandwidth Calculation

A typical FM signal requires approximately 2-4 times more bandwidth than an equivalent SSB signal. For example, while an SSB voice transmission might occupy 2.7 kHz of spectrum, an FM voice transmission could require 10-20 kHz—far exceeding the narrow channel allocations in HF bands.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Appropriate FM Usage:
- **VHF/UHF Bands**: FM is standard for local communications on 2m and 70cm bands
- **Repeater Operations**: Wide channel spacing allows efficient FM use
- **Local Emergency Communications**: Clear audio quality makes FM valuable for local nets

### ❌ Problematic FM Application in HF:
- **Crowded 20m Band**: An FM signal would block multiple nearby stations
- **Weak Signal Conditions**: FM's wide bandwidth reduces effective communication range
- **DX (Long Distance) Contacts**: SSB provides better signal penetration and narrower spectrum usage

## Practical Applications

### For Frequency Management:
1. **Spectrum Conservation**: Limit wide-bandwidth modes to bands with sufficient space
2. **Interference Reduction**: Use spectrally efficient modes in crowded frequency ranges
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure emissions meet ISED bandwidth restrictions

### For Mode Selection:
1. **Choose SSB for HF Voice**: Narrow bandwidth, good signal penetration
2. **Use FM for Local VHF/UHF**: Clear audio, good for repeater and local communications
3. **Select CW for Extremely Narrow Bandwidth**: Ideal for weak signal conditions

### Memory Aid:
"**F**requency **M**odulation = **F**at **M**odulation (of spectrum)"
