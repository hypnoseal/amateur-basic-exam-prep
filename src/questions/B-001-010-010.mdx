question: "Which of these amateur radio bands may be heavily occupied by licence-exempt devices?"
answers:
  - text: "902 MHz to 928 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The 902-928 MHz band is a frequency range heavily populated by licence-exempt devices like wireless networks, baby monitors, and various unlicensed wireless communications technologies. This Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band allows multiple low-power devices to operate without individual licensing, creating a complex and potentially interference-prone environment for amateur radio operators."
  - text: "3.5 MHz to 4.0 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 80-meter amateur radio band (3.5-4.0 MHz) is primarily used by licensed amateur radio operators and is not typically occupied by licence-exempt devices. This band is subject to specific amateur radio allocations and is protected from widespread unlicensed use."
  - text: "430 MHz to 450 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 70-centimeter amateur radio band (430-450 MHz) is primarily used by amateur radio operators and is not a common frequency range for licence-exempt devices. While some limited unlicensed devices might operate nearby, this band is not significantly occupied by unlicensed technologies."
  - text: "135.7 kHz to 137.8 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 2200-meter band (135.7-137.8 kHz) is a specialized amateur radio allocation with very limited device activity. This low-frequency band is not typically used by licence-exempt devices and requires specific amateur radio licensing for transmission."

# Licence-Exempt Devices and Amateur Radio: Understanding Spectrum Sharing

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What licence-exempt devices are and how they impact radio spectrum
- The characteristics of the 902-928 MHz band
- Potential interference challenges for amateur radio operators
- The importance of frequency allocation and device regulations

## The Concept: Licence-Exempt Spectrum and Amateur Radio

**Licence-exempt devices** are radio transmitters that can operate without individual government licensing, typically with low power and restricted technical parameters. These devices are designed to minimize interference while sharing spectrum with other services, including amateur radio.

The 902-928 MHz band is a classic example of an Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band that allows multiple technologies to coexist. This frequency range has become a "wild west" of wireless communications, hosting technologies like:
- Wi-Fi networks
- Wireless security systems
- Baby monitors
- Cordless phones
- Some remote control and telemetry systems
- Low-power wireless sensors and networks

### Why This Band is Unique

Unlike more strictly regulated amateur radio bands, the 902-928 MHz range is designed for flexible, low-power device deployment. The Federal communications regulators have created a spectrum environment that prioritizes innovation and accessibility over strict control.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Typical Licence-Exempt Devices in 902-928 MHz:
- **Home Wi-Fi Routers**: Spread-spectrum technologies operating in this band
- **Wireless Sensor Networks**: Industrial monitoring systems
- **Remote Control Systems**: Low-power wireless control mechanisms
- **Medical Telemetry Devices**: Portable health monitoring equipment

### ❌ Bands Not Typically Occupied by Licence-Exempt Devices:
- **Amateur HF Bands**: Strictly controlled, requiring specific licensing
- **Cellular Frequency Ranges**: Licensed commercial services
- **Aviation and Maritime Communication Bands**: Highly regulated professional services

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Interference Awareness**: Understand potential noise sources in the 902-928 MHz band
2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Use advanced filtering and receiver techniques
3. **Cooperative Spectrum Use**: Develop techniques to coexist with licence-exempt technologies

### For Spectrum Management:
1. **Shared Spectrum Principles**: Recognize how different services can use the same frequency range
2. **Low-Power Device Protocols**: Understand technologies that minimize interference
3. **Adaptive Transmission Techniques**: Learn how devices share spectrum efficiently

### Memory Aid:
"**9-0-2**: **N**o **O**wnership, **T**echnology Shares" - The 902-928 MHz band is a shared technological playground.
