question: "Out of the list of resistor tolerances below, which has the lowest precision?"
answers:
  - text: "20%"
    correct: true
    explanation: "20% tolerance represents the least precise resistor specification, allowing the actual resistance to vary by up to ±20% from its nominal value. This means a 100 Ω resistor with 20% tolerance could have an actual resistance anywhere between 80 Ω and 120 Ω, making it the least accurate among the given options."
  - text: "0.1%"
    correct: false
    explanation: "0.1% tolerance is an extremely precise resistor specification, allowing only minimal variation from the nominal resistance value. This represents the highest precision in the given list, where a 100 Ω resistor would have an actual value between 99.9 Ω and 100.1 Ω."
  - text: "5%"
    correct: false
    explanation: "5% tolerance is a moderately precise resistor specification, allowing the actual resistance to vary by ±5% from its nominal value. For a 100 Ω resistor, this means an actual resistance between 95 Ω and 105 Ω, which is much more precise than 20% tolerance."
  - text: "10%"
    correct: false
    explanation: "10% tolerance represents a moderate level of precision, allowing the actual resistance to vary by ±10% from its nominal value. For a 100 Ω resistor, this means an actual resistance between 90 Ω and 110 Ω, which is more precise than 20% tolerance but less precise than 5% or 0.1%."

## The Concept: Resistor Tolerance and Precision

Resistor tolerance is a specification that describes how closely a resistor's actual resistance matches its nominal (labeled) value. Think of it like a recipe where the ingredients can vary slightly from the exact measurements. The lower the tolerance percentage, the more precise the resistor.

When an electronic component is manufactured, it's impossible to create resistors with exactly the same resistance every time. Tolerance tells you the maximum expected deviation from the nominal value. A lower percentage means less variation and higher precision.

### How Tolerance Works

A resistor's tolerance is expressed as a plus-or-minus percentage around its nominal value. For example:
- A 100 Ω resistor with 20% tolerance could be between 80 Ω and 120 Ω
- A 100 Ω resistor with 5% tolerance could be between 95 Ω and 105 Ω
- A 100 Ω resistor with 0.1% tolerance could be between 99.9 Ω and 100.1 Ω

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Tolerance in Practical Applications:
- **High-Precision Circuits**: Measurement equipment, medical devices use 0.1% or 1% resistors
- **Audio Circuits**: Precision amplifier designs often require low-tolerance components
- **Calibration Equipment**: Scientific instruments demand extremely precise resistances

### ❌ Consequences of High Tolerance:
- **Signal Distortion**: High-tolerance resistors in audio circuits can introduce unwanted variations
- **Reduced Circuit Accuracy**: Measurement and sensor circuits become less reliable
- **Performance Inconsistency**: Electronic devices may vary in performance between individual units

## Practical Applications

### For Circuit Design:
1. **Choose Appropriate Tolerance**: Select resistor tolerance based on circuit requirements
2. **Budget Considerations**: Lower tolerance = higher cost
3. **Performance vs. Cost Trade-offs**: Balance precision needs with component expenses

### Resistor Tolerance Hierarchy:
1. **20%**: Lowest precision, used in basic circuits
2. **10%**: General-purpose electronics
3. **5%**: More precise applications
4. **1%**: Precision circuits
5. **0.1%**: Highest precision, specialized equipment

### Memory Aid:
"**L**arger **%** = **L**ess Precision" - The higher the tolerance percentage, the less precise the resistor.
