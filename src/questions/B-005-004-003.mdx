question: "How is the resistance in a DC circuit calculated when the voltage and current are known?"
answers:
  - text: "Resistance equals voltage divided by current"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This follows Ohm's Law (R = V/I), which is the fundamental equation describing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits. By dividing the voltage by the current, you determine the resistance of the circuit or component. This calculation allows you to understand how much opposition to electrical flow exists in a given circuit."
  - text: "Resistance equals current multiplied by current"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation is mathematically incorrect and does not represent any standard electrical relationship. Multiplying current by itself would not produce a meaningful resistance value and violates the principles of Ohm's Law."
  - text: "Resistance equals power divided by voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is not the correct method for calculating resistance. While power (P = V × I) is related to voltage and current, dividing power by voltage does not yield resistance. This approach would produce an incorrect and meaningless result in electrical calculations."
  - text: "Resistance equals current divided by voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This calculation is the inverse of Ohm's Law and produces an incorrect result. Dividing current by voltage would not provide a meaningful measure of electrical resistance and contradicts the fundamental principles of electrical circuit analysis."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Electrical Resistance

Electrical resistance is a fundamental property that describes how much a material or component opposes the flow of electric current. **Ohm's Law** provides the mathematical relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R), expressed by the equation: R = V/I.

Think of electrical current like water flowing through a pipe. Resistance is similar to the pipe's diameter and internal friction - it determines how easily the current can flow. Just as a narrow, rough pipe restricts water flow, electrical resistance restricts the movement of electrons in a circuit.

### The Mathematical Relationship

In a direct current (DC) circuit, resistance remains constant when voltage and current are measured. By dividing the voltage by the current, you can determine the precise resistance of a circuit or component. This calculation is crucial for understanding how electrical systems will behave and for designing efficient electrical and electronic circuits.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Resistance Calculations:
- **12V Circuit**: If a circuit has 12 volts and draws 2 amperes, the resistance is 6 ohms (12V ÷ 2A = 6Ω)
- **Battery-Powered Device**: A 9V battery supplying 0.5A through a component indicates that component has 18 ohms of resistance (9V ÷ 0.5A = 18Ω)
- **LED Circuit**: A LED drawing 0.02A at 2V has a resistance of 100 ohms (2V ÷ 0.02A = 100Ω)

### ❌ Incorrect Calculation Methods:
- **Multiplying Voltage and Current**: This produces watts (power), not resistance
- **Dividing Current by Voltage**: Produces an inverted and meaningless result
- **Guessing or Estimating**: Always use precise measurements and Ohm's Law
