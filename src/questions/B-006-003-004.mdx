question: "What type of connector is commonly installed on RG-213 coaxial cable for connection to an HF transceiver?"
answers:
  - text: "A PL-259 connector"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The PL-259 (also known as the 'UHF connector') is the standard connector for RG-213 coaxial cable in HF amateur radio applications. It provides a robust, reliable connection with low signal loss, good mechanical strength, and easy installation. This connector is specifically designed to handle the power levels and frequency ranges typical of HF amateur radio equipment, making it the preferred choice for connecting transceivers, antenna tuners, and other station components."
  - text: "An F-type connector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "F-type connectors are typically used in cable television and satellite installations, not in amateur radio HF applications. They have lower power handling capabilities and are not designed for the rugged environment of amateur radio equipment. These connectors are too fragile and have higher signal loss at HF frequencies compared to the PL-259."
  - text: "An SMA connector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "SMA (Sub-Miniature version A) connectors are much smaller and typically used in VHF/UHF handheld radios, test equipment, and some modern compact transceivers. They are not suitable for standard RG-213 coaxial cable in HF applications due to their smaller size, lower power handling, and different mechanical design."
  - text: "A BNC connector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) connectors are typically used in lower-power RF applications like test equipment, radio receivers, and some VHF/UHF systems. They have lower power handling capabilities and are not robust enough for typical HF transceiver connections using RG-213 cable."

# The PL-259 Connector: Standard for HF Amateur Radio Coaxial Connections

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The unique characteristics of the PL-259 connector
- Why PL-259 is preferred for HF amateur radio applications
- How to identify and install PL-259 connectors
- The differences between various RF connector types

## The Concept: RF Connector Fundamentals

Radio frequency (RF) connectors are specialized electrical interfaces designed to maintain signal integrity, minimize signal loss, and provide reliable connections between different components in a radio system. The PL-259, often called the "UHF connector" despite not being a true UHF-band connector, has been a staple in amateur radio for decades.

### Anatomy of the PL-259 Connector

The PL-259 consists of several key components:
- A center pin for the signal conductor
- A threaded outer sleeve for secure mechanical connection
- A dielectric insulator to maintain proper impedance
- Designed specifically for RG-213 type coaxial cables (52-ohm impedance)

Its robust design allows it to handle the higher power levels typical in HF amateur radio transmissions, making it ideal for connecting transceivers, antenna tuners, and transmission line components.

## Practical Applications

### For Connector Installation:
1. **Proper Cable Preparation**: Strip cable carefully, maintaining precise center conductor and shield lengths
2. **Soldering Technique**: Use high-quality solder and ensure clean, complete connections
3. **Mechanical Strain Relief**: Provide adequate cable support to prevent connector stress

### For Different Station Configurations:
1. **Contesting Stations**: Rely on PL-259's robust design for frequent equipment changes
2. **Portable Operations**: Appreciate the connector's mechanical durability
3. **Emergency Communications**: Depend on reliable, field-serviceable connections

### Memory Aid:
