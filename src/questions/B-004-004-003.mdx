question: "In a field-effect transistor, which electrode controls the resistance of the device's channel?"
answers:
  - text: "Gate"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The gate electrode in a field-effect transistor (FET) controls the channel resistance by modulating the electric field that determines the channel's conductivity. By applying a voltage to the gate, the semiconductor material's electron flow can be restricted or enhanced, effectively changing the channel's resistance without direct current flow through the gate itself."
  - text: "Drain"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The drain is the electrode where current flows out of the transistor's channel, but it does not control the channel's resistance. It serves as the output terminal of the device, experiencing current flow based on the gate's voltage-controlled channel conditions."
  - text: "Source"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The source is the input terminal where current enters the transistor's channel, but it does not control the channel's resistance. Like the drain, it is a terminal through which current flows, with the channel's conductivity determined by the gate voltage."
  - text: "Collector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The collector is a term used in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), not field-effect transistors. In a FET, the collector does not exist, and this answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of transistor types and their fundamental operating principles."

## The Concept: Gate Control in Field-Effect Transistors

A field-effect transistor (FET) is a voltage-controlled semiconductor device that uses an electric field to control the flow of current through a semiconductor channel. Unlike bipolar junction transistors that rely on current flow to control current, FETs modulate current flow by changing the channel's resistance through an applied gate voltage.

The FET's channel is a semiconductor path between the source and drain electrodes. The gate electrode is positioned adjacent to this channel, separated by a thin insulating layer (in the case of MOSFETs) or a reverse-biased P-N junction (in junction FETs). When a voltage is applied to the gate, it creates an electric field that influences the channel's electron density and, consequently, its electrical resistance.

### The Gate's Electrical Mechanism

Think of the gate like a valve controlling water flow in a pipe. Just as a valve can narrow or widen a pipe's opening to restrict or enhance water flow, the gate voltage can:
- Narrow the channel, increasing resistance
- Widen the channel, decreasing resistance
- Completely shut off current flow (pinch-off)

This voltage-controlled behavior makes FETs ideal for amplification, switching, and signal processing in electronic circuits.
