question: "If the forward gain of a six-element Yagi is about 10 dBi, what would the gain of two of these antennas be if they were \"stacked\"?"
answers:
  - text: "13 dBi"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two identical directional antennas are stacked vertically, the theoretical gain increase is approximately 3 dB. Since the original single Yagi has 10 dBi of gain, stacking two identical Yagis will result in a combined gain of about 13 dBi. This gain increase occurs due to constructive interference between the antenna elements, which concentrates the radiated energy in a narrower vertical beamwidth while increasing overall forward gain."
  - text: "7 dBi"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would represent a reduction in gain, which doesn't occur when properly stacking identical antennas. The vertical stacking of two identical Yagis always results in a gain increase, not a decrease, assuming proper spacing and phasing."
  - text: "20 dBi"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While stacking does increase antenna gain, the increase is typically around 3 dB, not a doubling of the original gain. A 20 dBi result would represent an unrealistic and impractical gain multiplication that doesn't match real-world antenna performance."
  - text: "10 dBi"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would indicate no gain increase from stacking, which is incorrect. Proper vertical stacking of identical antennas always provides some increase in forward gain, typically around 3 dB."

## The Concept: Antenna Stacking and Gain Multiplication

Antenna stacking is a technique used by amateur radio operators to increase the directional gain and improve the radiation pattern of directional antennas like Yagis. When two identical antennas are carefully positioned and fed with precisely phased signals, they create a more focused radiation pattern with increased forward gain.

The fundamental principle behind antenna stacking is **constructive interference**. By vertically separating two identical antennas and feeding them with precisely matched signals, the radiated energy from each antenna combines in a way that concentrates the signal in a preferred direction. This process typically results in approximately 3 dB of additional gain compared to a single antenna.

### The Physics of Vertical Stacking

When antennas are stacked, several key factors determine their combined performance:
- **Vertical Spacing**: Typically 0.5 to 1 wavelength apart
- **Phase Matching**: Signals must be precisely synchronized
- **Identical Antenna Design**: Both antennas must have identical characteristics

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Successful Antenna Stacking Scenarios:
- **VHF/UHF Weak Signal Work**: Stacked Yagis providing enhanced long-distance communication
- **Contesting Stations**: Maximizing signal strength and directivity
- **DX (Long Distance) Contacts**: Improving weak signal reception

### ❌ Ineffective Stacking Approaches:
- **Mismatched Antennas**: Using different antenna designs or sizes
- **Improper Phasing**: Signals not precisely synchronized
- **Incorrect Vertical Spacing**: Too close or too far apart

2. **Mechanical Considerations**: Plan for robust mounting and wind loading
3. **Phasing Systems**: Use precision phasing harnesses for optimal performance

### Stacking Techniques:
1. **Vertical Stacking**: Most common method for Yagi antennas
2. **Horizontal Stacking**: Alternative method with different radiation characteristics
3. **Multiple Element Arrays**: More complex stacking for extreme gain requirements
