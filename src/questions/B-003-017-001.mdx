question: "You construct a simple DC power supply using a transformer, rectifier and filter capacitor. If you use the supply to power a CW transmitter, what problem with signal quality could it cause?"
answers:
  - text: "Chirp"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Chirp occurs when the transmitter's frequency shifts slightly during a CW transmission due to power supply voltage variations. In a simple, poorly filtered DC power supply, the voltage can fluctuate as the filter capacitor discharges between rectifier cycles, causing small but detectable frequency variations in the transmitted signal. These rapid frequency shifts create an audible 'chirp' sound when the signal is received, indicating instability in the transmitter's oscillator circuit."
  - text: "Key clicks"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Key clicks are caused by abrupt switching of the transmitter's RF output, typically resulting from too-sharp rise and fall times when keying the transmitter. They are a result of rapid signal transitions, not power supply voltage fluctuations. Key clicks create spurious signals in adjacent frequencies and are typically addressed through keying circuit design and rise-time shaping."
  - text: "Harmonics"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Harmonics are additional frequency components that are integer multiples of the fundamental transmission frequency. While power supply issues can contribute to harmonic generation, they are not directly caused by the type of voltage fluctuations described in this scenario. Harmonics are more related to non-linear amplification and circuit design rather than power supply filtering."
  - text: "Overmodulation"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Overmodulation occurs when the amplitude of a modulated signal exceeds its designed limits, typically in voice or AM modes. This is not related to the power supply issues described in a CW transmitter, which operates with on-off keying rather than amplitude modulation. Overmodulation causes signal distortion in voice modes but is not applicable to CW transmission."

## The Concept: Power Supply Stability and Signal Quality

A **chirp** in amateur radio represents an unwanted frequency variation during continuous wave (CW) transmission. This occurs when the transmitter's oscillator experiences slight frequency shifts due to unstable power supply voltage. In essence, the power supply becomes more than just an electrical source—it becomes a potential source of signal distortion.

In a simple DC power supply, the process involves multiple stages: transformer step-down, rectification, and filtering. The filter capacitor plays a crucial role in smoothing voltage variations. However, in basic designs, this capacitor can discharge between rectifier cycles, causing momentary voltage drops that destabilize the transmitter's oscillator frequency.

### The Physics of Voltage and Frequency

Think of the transmitter's oscillator like a musical instrument string. Just as a string's vibration depends on its tension, an oscillator's frequency depends on its operating voltage. When voltage fluctuates, the oscillator's "tension" changes slightly, producing minute frequency shifts—the chirp.
