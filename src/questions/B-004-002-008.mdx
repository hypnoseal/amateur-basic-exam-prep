question: "What semiconductor device glows different colours, depending upon its chemical composition?"
answers:
  - text: "A light-emitting diode"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are semiconductor devices that produce light through electroluminescence, with the specific color determined by the bandgap energy of the semiconductor materials used in their construction. By changing the chemical composition of the semiconductor layers, manufacturers can precisely engineer LEDs to emit different colors across the visible spectrum."
  - text: "A fluorescent bulb"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Fluorescent bulbs are gas-discharge devices that use mercury vapor and phosphor coatings to produce light, not semiconductor technology. The color is created by phosphors coating the inside of the glass tube, not by the intrinsic properties of the device itself. These bulbs do not change color based on their chemical composition like LEDs do."
  - text: "A neon bulb"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Neon bulbs are gas-discharge devices that glow based on the specific noble gas used (typically neon), but they are not semiconductors. Their color is determined by the gas type and electrical excitation, not by chemical semiconductor composition like LEDs."
  - text: "A vacuum diode"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Vacuum diodes are electronic components using electron emission in a vacuum tube, which do not emit light as a primary function. They are based on thermionic emission and do not have the semiconductor properties that allow color variation through chemical composition."

## The Concept: Semiconductor Light Generation

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) represent a fascinating intersection of semiconductor physics and optical technology. Unlike traditional light sources that produce light through heating or gas discharge, LEDs generate light through a quantum mechanical process called **electroluminescence**.

When an electric current passes through a semiconductor junction, electrons move from a higher energy state (conduction band) to a lower energy state (valence band), releasing energy in the form of photons. The specific wavelength (and thus color) of these photons depends on the energy difference between these bands, which is directly controlled by the semiconductor's chemical composition.

### Bandgap Engineering

Semiconductor manufacturers can precisely "tune" the bandgap energy by changing the material's chemical composition. Common semiconductor materials for LEDs include:
- Gallium Arsenide (GaAs): Infrared and red LEDs
- Gallium Phosphide (GaP): Green and yellow LEDs
- Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN): Blue and white LEDs

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ LED Color Variations:
- **Red LEDs**: Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) semiconductors
- **Blue LEDs**: Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) with precise chemical ratios
- **White LEDs**: Blue LED with yellow phosphor coating

### ❌ Non-Semiconductor Light Sources:
- **Incandescent Bulbs**: Color based on filament temperature, not chemical composition
- **Neon Signs**: Gas discharge color based on noble gas type
- **Fluorescent Tubes**: Phosphor coating determines color, not semiconductor properties
