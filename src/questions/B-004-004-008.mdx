question: "In a field-effect transistor, what circuit parameter change causes the current to increase?"
answers:
  - text: "The reverse bias is decreased"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a field-effect transistor (FET), decreasing the reverse bias between the gate and source narrows the depletion region, effectively increasing the channel conductivity and allowing more current to flow through the device. This reduction in reverse bias reduces the width of the depletion region, creating a wider conductive path for current and thus increasing the drain-source current."
  - text: "The reverse bias is increased"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Increasing the reverse bias actually widens the depletion region, which reduces the effective cross-sectional area of the conducting channel. This causes the current to decrease, not increase, by making it more difficult for charge carriers to flow through the transistor."
  - text: "A forward bias is applied"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FETs operate using reverse bias, not forward bias. Applying a forward bias is a characteristic of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), not field-effect transistors. In a FET, the gate-source junction is always reverse-biased to control current flow."
  - text: "A forward bias is removed"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Removing a forward bias would not affect an FET's operation, as FETs do not use forward biasing. The current in a FET is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate with respect to the source, which is typically a reverse bias condition."

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

## The Concept: Field-Effect Transistor Fundamentals

A field-effect transistor (FET) is a voltage-controlled electronic device that regulates current flow through a semiconductor channel. Unlike bipolar junction transistors that use current input, FETs control current using an electric field created by the gate voltage.

The key mechanism in an FET is the **depletion region** - an area near the gate where charge carriers are depleted, effectively narrowing the conducting channel. By applying a reverse bias voltage to the gate, you can control the width of this depletion region, which directly impacts the transistor's current-carrying capacity.

### How Reverse Bias Affects Current Flow

When you decrease the reverse bias voltage between the gate and source:
- The depletion region becomes narrower
- More of the semiconductor channel becomes available for current flow
- The effective cross-sectional area for charge carriers increases
- Drain-source current consequently increases

Think of it like adjusting a water valve: reducing the gate voltage is similar to opening the valve wider, allowing more current to flow through the channel.
