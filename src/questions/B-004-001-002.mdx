question: "If an amplifier becomes non-linear, the output signal would:"
answers:
  - text: "become distorted"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a non-linear amplifier, the output signal no longer maintains a proportional relationship with the input signal. This means the amplification process introduces additional frequencies and changes the waveform shape, creating harmonic distortion. The fundamental input signal is modified, producing additional unwanted frequency components that alter the original signal's pure sinusoidal or complex waveform."
  - text: "be reduced to zero"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Non-linearity does not necessarily mean the signal becomes zero. Instead, it means the amplifier's response is not consistently proportional across all input signal levels. The output will still exist, but it will be distorted and contain additional unintended frequency components that were not present in the original input signal."
  - text: "cause oscillations"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While non-linear behavior can potentially contribute to instability in some circuits, oscillation is a separate phenomenon from signal distortion. Non-linearity specifically refers to uneven amplification, whereas oscillation involves a circuit generating its own periodic signal without an external input."
  - text: "overload the power supply"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Non-linearity is a characteristic of the amplification process itself, not a direct cause of power supply overload. While severe non-linear behavior might draw more current, the primary effect is signal distortion, not power supply stress. Power supply issues are a separate concern from the amplifier's linearity characteristics."

## The Concept: Amplifier Linearity and Signal Fidelity

An **ideal linear amplifier** reproduces an input signal with perfect proportionality - meaning the output is an exact, scaled version of the input. Imagine stretching a rubber band: if you pull it twice as far, it provides twice the resistance. In a perfectly linear amplifier, doubling the input voltage would precisely double the output voltage, maintaining the original signal's shape.

**Non-linear amplification** occurs when this proportional relationship breaks down. Instead of producing a faithful, scaled reproduction of the input signal, the amplifier introduces additional frequency components, changes the signal's shape, and creates harmonic distortions. This is similar to a musical instrument producing unwanted overtones when played too loudly or aggressively.

### The Physics of Signal Distortion

When an amplifier becomes non-linear, it essentially "breaks" the smooth mathematical relationship between input and output. This happens when the amplifying components (like transistors or vacuum tubes) are pushed beyond their designed operating range. The result is a signal that looks more like a badly drawn approximation of the original waveform, with additional "bumps" and "harmonics" that were not in the original signal.
