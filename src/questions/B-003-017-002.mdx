question: "What device converts 120 volts AC to 12 volts DC?"
answers:
  - text: "Power supply"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A power supply is an electronic device specifically designed to convert alternating current (AC) from standard wall outlets to direct current (DC) at a lower voltage required by electronic devices. In amateur radio, power supplies convert 120V AC household power to 12V DC to power transceivers, amplifiers, and other radio equipment, ensuring stable and consistent electrical power for sensitive electronic components."
  - text: "Low-pass filter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A low-pass filter is an electronic circuit that allows low-frequency signals to pass through while blocking high-frequency signals. It is used for managing radio frequency interference and signal quality, but it does not convert electrical power from AC to DC. This device is used for signal processing, not power conversion."
  - text: "Inverter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "An inverter actually does the opposite of what the question asks - it converts DC power to AC power. Inverters are used to power AC devices from DC sources like batteries or solar panels, but they do not convert AC power to DC power at a lower voltage as described in the question."
  - text: "Power conditioner"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A power conditioner is designed to improve the quality of electrical power by filtering out noise, smoothing voltage fluctuations, and providing surge protection. While it can improve power quality, it does not convert AC power to DC power at a different voltage level."

# Power Conversion Basics: Understanding Power Supplies in Amateur Radio

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What a power supply is and how it works
- The difference between AC and DC power
- Why amateur radio equipment requires DC power
- How power supplies are critical to radio station operation

## The Concept: Power Conversion and DC Power

Electrical power comes in two fundamental forms: Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC). The standard household electrical outlet provides 120 volts AC, but most electronic devices, including amateur radio equipment, require low-voltage DC power to operate.

A **power supply** is an electronic device that transforms high-voltage AC power into low-voltage DC power through a process involving transformers, rectifiers, and voltage regulators. In amateur radio, this typically means converting 120V AC from a wall outlet to 12V DC for powering transceivers, amplifiers, and other radio equipment.

### The Power Conversion Process

The power supply performs three critical functions:
1. **Voltage Transformation**: Reducing 120V to a lower voltage
2. **Rectification**: Converting AC's wave-like power to steady DC
3. **Regulation**: Maintaining a consistent, stable output voltage

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Appropriate Power Supply Applications:
- **Amateur Radio Transceiver**: Converting 120V AC to 12V DC for powering a radio
- **Mobile Radio Installation**: Connecting radio equipment to a vehicle's electrical system
- **Portable Repeater**: Providing stable DC power from AC or battery sources

### ❌ Incorrect Power Conversion Devices:
- **Low-Pass Filter**: Signal processing, not power conversion
- **Inverter**: Converting DC to AC (opposite of the required conversion)
- **Power Conditioner**: Improving power quality, not changing voltage or current type

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Stations:
1. **Select Appropriate Voltage Rating**: Match power supply output to equipment requirements
2. **Consider Current Capacity**: Ensure supply can handle peak power demands
3. **Use Regulated Supplies**: Maintain consistent voltage for sensitive electronics

### Selecting a Power Supply:
1. **Calculate Total Power Requirements**: Add up power needs of all connected devices
2. **Choose Supply with 20-30% Extra Capacity**: Allow for future expansion
3. **Consider Cooling and Ventilation**: Prevent overheating during extended use
