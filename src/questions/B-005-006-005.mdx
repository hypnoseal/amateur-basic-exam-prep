question: "When two 500-ohm 1-watt resistors are connected in parallel, they can dissipate a maximum total power of:"
answers:
  - text: "2 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in parallel, their total power dissipation increases because the current is divided between them while the voltage remains the same. Each 500-ohm, 1-watt resistor can individually dissipate 1 watt, so when connected in parallel, they can collectively dissipate 2 watts total. This occurs because the parallel connection allows each resistor to handle its rated power independently."
  - text: "0.5 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because parallel resistors do not reduce power dissipation. In a parallel connection, each resistor receives the full voltage and can dissipate its rated power. Connecting two 1-watt resistors in parallel increases total power dissipation, not reduces it."
  - text: "1 watt"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because parallel resistors combine their power handling capabilities. Two 1-watt resistors in parallel can dissipate a total of 2 watts, not just 1 watt. Each resistor maintains its individual power rating when connected in parallel."
  - text: "4 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because while parallel resistors increase total power dissipation, they do not quadruple the power rating. Two 1-watt resistors in parallel can dissipate 2 watts total, not 4 watts. The power increase is additive, not multiplicative."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistor Power Dynamics

When resistors are connected in parallel, they share the same voltage but divide the total current. This unique characteristic means that each resistor can dissipate its full rated power independently, resulting in a cumulative power handling capability that is the sum of individual resistor ratings.

In electrical terms, power (P) is calculated by the formula P = V² / R, where V is voltage and R is resistance. When resistors are in parallel, the voltage remains constant across each resistor, allowing each to contribute its full power capacity to the overall circuit.

### The Mathematical Principle

For two identical resistors in parallel:
- Total power = Individual resistor power × Number of resistors
- In this case: 1 watt × 2 = 2 watts total power dissipation

This principle is critical in designing circuits that require higher power handling without increasing voltage or changing individual component ratings.
