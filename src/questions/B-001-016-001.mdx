question: "What is the maximum authorized bandwidth on the 6-metre and 2-metre bands?"
answers:
  - text: "30 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "30 kHz is the maximum authorized bandwidth for amateur radio operations on the 6-metre and 2-metre bands according to Canadian amateur radio regulations. This bandwidth limit ensures efficient spectrum use, prevents interference between stations, and allows multiple users to share these popular VHF bands effectively. The 30 kHz limit applies to most modes of transmission, including FM, SSB, and digital modes."
  - text: "20 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "20 kHz is not the correct maximum authorized bandwidth for 6-metre and 2-metre bands. While this bandwidth might be close to the actual limit, it falls short of the official 30 kHz maximum specified in Canadian amateur radio regulations. Using a bandwidth less than the authorized maximum could unnecessarily restrict your communication capabilities."
  - text: "6 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "6 kHz is significantly narrower than the authorized maximum bandwidth of 30 kHz for 6-metre and 2-metre bands. This bandwidth would severely limit the types of modes and communication methods you could use, such as FM voice, digital modes, and wide-bandwidth data transmissions that are common on these VHF bands."
  - text: "5 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "5 kHz is far too narrow for standard amateur radio operations on 6-metre and 2-metre bands. This bandwidth would drastically restrict communication capabilities, making it difficult to use typical voice and digital modes. The actual maximum authorized bandwidth is 30 kHz, which provides much more flexibility for different communication techniques."

# VHF Band Bandwidth: Understanding Spectrum Allocation on 6-Metre and 2-Metre Bands

## Learning Objectives

## The Concept: Amateur Radio Bandwidth Allocation

Bandwidth in amateur radio refers to the range of frequencies occupied by a radio signal during transmission. It's a critical parameter that determines how much information can be transmitted and how efficiently the radio spectrum is used.

For the 6-metre (50-54 MHz) and 2-metre (144-148 MHz) bands, the maximum authorized bandwidth is 30 kHz. This limit ensures that amateur radio operators can:
- Efficiently share limited spectrum resources
- Minimize interference between stations
- Accommodate various communication modes like voice, digital, and data transmissions

### Bandwidth and Communication Modes

Different communication modes require different amounts of spectrum:
- FM Voice: Typically 16 kHz
- SSB Voice: Around 2.7 kHz
- Digital Modes: Varies from 500 Hz to 30 kHz
- Packet Radio: Often uses 9600 baud modes within the 30 kHz limit

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Compliant Bandwidth Usage:
- **FM Repeater**: Uses approximately 16 kHz, well within the 30 kHz limit
- **Digital Voice Mode**: Fits comfortably within the 30 kHz allocation
- **Wide-Bandwidth Data Transmission**: Can utilize up to 30 kHz for high-speed data

### ❌ Bandwidth Violations:
- **Overwidth Modulation**: Signals exceeding 30 kHz cause interference
- **Improperly Configured Transmitters**: Can generate spurious emissions beyond authorized bandwidth

## Practical Applications

### For VHF Band Operations:
1. **Repeater Coordination**: 30 kHz bandwidth allows multiple repeater channels
2. **Mode Flexibility**: Supports various communication techniques
3. **Interference Management**: Prevents spectrum crowding

### For Different Communication Techniques:
1. **Voice Communications**: Standard FM voice typically uses 16 kHz
2. **Digital Modes**: Can use wider bandwidths up to 30 kHz
3. **Experimental Techniques**: Provides room for innovation within regulated limits

### Memory Aid:
"**T**hree **Z**ero - Thirty kHz is the **Z**one" (30 kHz bandwidth)
