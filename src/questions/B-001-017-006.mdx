question: "What is the maximum effective radiated power (ERP), expressed as peak envelope power (PEP), the holder of an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate with Advanced Qualification may use on 60 metres?"
answers:
  - text: "100 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "For the 60-metre band, Advanced-level amateur radio operators are limited to a maximum of 100 watts Peak Envelope Power (PEP). This power limit is specifically defined in the Canadian amateur radio regulations to manage potential interference and ensure efficient spectrum use. The 100-watt limit allows for effective communication while minimizing the risk of harmful interference to other services that share or are adjacent to this band."
  - text: "250 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "250 watts exceeds the authorized power limit for the 60-metre band. Advanced-level amateur radio operators are restricted to 100 watts PEP on this frequency band. Transmitting at higher power levels would violate ISED regulations and potentially cause harmful interference to other radio services."
  - text: "560 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "560 watts is significantly higher than the authorized power limit for 60-metre band operations. Advanced-level amateur radio operators are strictly limited to 100 watts Peak Envelope Power (PEP) on this band. Transmitting at this power level would be a serious violation of Canadian amateur radio regulations."
  - text: "2250 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "2250 watts is an extremely high power level that far exceeds the authorized limit for the 60-metre band. Advanced-level amateur radio operators are permitted only 100 watts Peak Envelope Power (PEP) on this frequency range. Transmitting at such high power would cause severe interference and violate multiple amateur radio regulatory requirements."

# Power Limits on the 60-Metre Band: Understanding ERP and PEP for Amateur Radio

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The specific power limitations for 60-metre band operations
- What Peak Envelope Power (PEP) means
- How power limits differ for various amateur radio license classes
- The importance of power regulation in spectrum management

## The Concept: Power Limits and Effective Radiated Power

**Effective Radiated Power (ERP)** is a measure of how much radio frequency energy is actually transmitted in a specific direction, taking into account both the transmitter's output power and the antenna's gain. **Peak Envelope Power (PEP)** represents the maximum power output during a transmission, typically used for single sideband (SSB) and digital modes.

The 60-metre band occupies a unique position in amateur radio spectrum allocation. Unlike other HF bands with more flexible power limits, this band has very specific regulatory constraints designed to minimize potential interference with other critical communications services.

### Why Power Limits Matter

Power limits aren't arbitrary restrictions but carefully calculated parameters that:
- Prevent interference with other radio services
- Manage spectrum sharing between different users
- Ensure safe and responsible radio operation
- Protect sensitive communication systems in adjacent frequency ranges

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Power Usage on 60 Metres:
- **SSB Voice Transmission**: Using exactly 100 watts PEP for long-distance communication
- **Digital Mode Operation**: Maintaining power output at or below 100 watts during data transmissions
- **Emergency Communications**: Utilizing full authorized power for critical communication needs

### ❌ Inappropriate Power Levels:
- **Exceeding 100 Watts**: Risking interference and regulatory violations
- **Uncontrolled Power Amplification**: Using unauthorized linear amplifiers
- **Miscalibrated Transmitter Settings**: Accidentally broadcasting above permitted power levels

## Practical Applications

### For 60-Metre Band Operations:
1. **Power Measurement**: Use calibrated power meters to verify actual transmission power
2. **Mode Considerations**: Adjust power settings for different communication modes
3. **Antenna Efficiency**: Understand how antenna design impacts effective radiated power

### For Advanced License Holders:
1. **Know Your Limits**: Always confirm power output before transmission
2. **Use Proper Measurement Tools**: Invest in accurate power measurement equipment
3. **Understand Regulatory Nuances**: Recognize band-specific power restrictions

### Memory Aid:
"**S**ixty **M**etres, **M**aximum **100**" - Remember the power limit for this unique band!
