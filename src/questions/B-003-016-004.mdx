question: "Which of the following is a source of electromotive force (EMF)?"
answers:
  - text: "Lithium-ion battery"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A lithium-ion battery is a primary source of electromotive force, converting chemical energy directly into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions. It creates a potential difference between its positive and negative terminals, generating an electric potential that can drive current through an external circuit. Lithium-ion batteries are characterized by their ability to generate EMF through the movement of lithium ions between the anode and cathode during charge and discharge cycles."
  - text: "Germanium diode"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A germanium diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction, but it does not generate electromotive force. While diodes are important electronic components that can rectify electrical signals, they do not create electrical potential on their own. They simply control the direction of current flow based on their semiconductor properties."
  - text: "P-channel FET"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A P-channel Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a semiconductor switching device used to control electrical current, but it does not generate electromotive force. FETs are active components that can amplify or switch electronic signals, but they require an external voltage source to operate and do not create electrical potential independently."
  - text: "Metal-film resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A metal-film resistor is a passive electronic component designed to provide electrical resistance in a circuit. It opposes the flow of electrical current and converts electrical energy into heat, but it does not generate electromotive force. Resistors are used to control current and voltage in electronic circuits but cannot create electrical potential on their own."

## The Concept: Electromotive Force and Electrical Potential

Electromotive force (EMF) is the potential difference created by an energy source that can drive electrical current through a circuit. It represents the work done per unit charge to move electrical charges from one point to another in a circuit. Unlike simple passive components that manage or oppose electrical current, EMF sources actively create electrical potential.

The fundamental characteristic of an EMF source is its ability to generate a voltage difference without requiring an external power input. This is typically achieved through chemical reactions, mechanical movement, or other energy conversion processes that create a potential difference between two points.

### Types of EMF Sources

Different technologies can generate electromotive force through various mechanisms:
- **Chemical Batteries**: Convert chemical energy into electrical energy
- **Solar Cells**: Transform light energy into electrical potential
- **Thermoelectric Generators**: Create voltage from temperature differences
- **Electromagnetic Generators**: Convert mechanical motion into electrical potential
