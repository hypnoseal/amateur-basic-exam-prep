question: "What is the wavelength in free space of a 2 MHz signal?"
answers:
  - text: "150 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This answer is correct because it results from applying the fundamental wave propagation formula: wavelength (λ) = speed of light (c) ÷ frequency (f). Using the speed of light as 300,000,000 m/s, dividing by 2,000,000 Hz yields exactly 150 metres. This calculation demonstrates the direct mathematical relationship between frequency and wavelength in free space."
  - text: "360 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect and doesn't follow the wavelength calculation formula. It's approximately 2.4 times the correct wavelength, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding of how wavelength relates to frequency."
  - text: "1500 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is ten times the correct wavelength, indicating a significant error in understanding the wavelength-frequency relationship. It would correspond to a frequency of about 200 kHz, not 2 MHz."
  - text: "30 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is too short, representing only one-fifth of the correct wavelength. It suggests a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the wave propagation formula."

## The Concept: Wave Propagation and Wavelength Calculation

Wavelength is the physical distance between successive wave peaks in a propagating electromagnetic wave. In radio communications, understanding wavelength is crucial for designing antennas, understanding signal propagation, and comprehending radio wave behavior.

The fundamental formula for calculating wavelength is: 
**λ (wavelength) = c (wave speed) ÷ f (frequency)**

For radio waves in free space, we use the speed of light (300,000,000 meters per second) as the wave speed. This means that as frequency increases, wavelength decreases proportionally, and vice versa.

### The Mathematical Relationship

For a 2 MHz signal:
- Frequency (f) = 2,000,000 Hz
- Wave speed (c) = 300,000,000 m/s
- Wavelength (λ) = 300,000,000 ÷ 2,000,000
- Wavelength = 150 metres

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Antenna Design**: Wavelength determines optimal antenna length
2. **Propagation Understanding**: Different wavelengths behave differently in various atmospheric conditions
3. **Band Planning**: Knowing wavelength helps select appropriate equipment and understand signal characteristics

### For Different Frequency Bands:
1. **HF Bands (1.8-30 MHz)**: Longer wavelengths (160-10 metres)
2. **VHF Bands (30-300 MHz)**: Shorter wavelengths (10-1 metres)
3. **UHF Bands (300-3000 MHz)**: Very short wavelengths (1-0.1 metres)

### Memory Aid:
"**300 ÷ f = λ**" - Speed of light divided by frequency gives wavelength!
