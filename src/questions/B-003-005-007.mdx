question: "In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the product detector?"
answers:
  - text: "Recover the transmitted modulation"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The product detector's primary function is to demodulate (recover) the original audio signal that was used to modulate the radio frequency carrier. By mathematically multiplying the incoming RF signal with a locally generated carrier signal, it extracts the original modulating information from single sideband (SSB) and continuous wave (CW) signals."
  - text: "For SSB reception, reject the unwanted sideband"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While SSB signals are generated with only one sideband, the rejection of the unwanted sideband actually occurs earlier in the receiver's signal processing chain, typically in the filter stages before the product detector. The product detector's role is signal recovery, not initial sideband filtering."
  - text: "Convert audio frequency electrical signals into sound"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Signal conversion to audible sound is actually the job of the audio amplifier and speaker, which comes after the product detector in the receiver's signal chain. The product detector specifically recovers the modulation information from the radio frequency signal."
  - text: "Detect frequency drift to control the local oscillator"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Frequency drift detection and local oscillator correction is a separate function typically handled by phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits or digital frequency stabilization systems, not the product detector. The product detector focuses on signal demodulation."

## The Concept: Signal Demodulation in Modern Receivers

A product detector is an advanced signal processing component found in sophisticated radio receivers, particularly those designed for single sideband (SSB) and continuous wave (CW) modes. Unlike traditional AM detectors that use simple diode rectification, product detectors use mathematical multiplication (mixing) to recover the original modulating signal.

The core principle involves taking the incoming radio frequency (RF) signal and multiplying it by a locally generated carrier signal of the same frequency. This mathematical operation—called coherent detection—allows the receiver to extract the original audio information that was used to modulate the transmitted signal.

### How Product Detection Works

Imagine the radio signal as a complex wave containing both the carrier and the modulating information. By multiplying this wave with a precisely generated local carrier, the product detector essentially "cancels out" the carrier frequency, leaving behind only the original audio or data signal. This process is mathematically equivalent to subtraction but is performed through signal multiplication.
