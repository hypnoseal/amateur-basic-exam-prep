question: "What method is used by amateur radio operators to provide proof of communication with another station?"
answers:
  - text: "A QSL card or entries in web-based logging systems"
    correct: true
    explanation: "QSL cards and web-based logging systems provide official documentation of a radio contact (QSO), serving as formal proof that two amateur radio stations successfully communicated. QSL cards are physical postcards containing specific contact details like date, time, frequency, mode, and signal reports, while modern web-based systems like LOTW (Logbook of the World) offer digital verification of contacts for award tracking and confirmation purposes."
  - text: "A letter detailing contact date, time, frequency, mode and power"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While a letter might contain similar information to a QSL card, it is not a standard or recognized method of proving amateur radio contact. Personal letters lack the formal structure and standardization of QSL cards or digital logging systems, and are not accepted by award programs or contest organizers as official proof of communication."
  - text: "A radiogram sent over amateur radio traffic nets"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Radiograms are message forms used for passing third-party communications, typically during emergency communications or public service events. While they involve radio transmission, they are not designed to serve as proof of contact between amateur radio stations. Their primary purpose is message delivery, not documenting the communication itself."
  - text: "A brief email or text message"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Emails and text messages are not considered valid proof of amateur radio communication because they do not involve radio transmission. Amateur radio contacts must be made via radio, and verification must come from methods directly related to radio communication, such as QSL cards or web-based logging systems that track actual radio contacts."

## The Concept: Proving Amateur Radio Contacts

Amateur radio is more than just communication—it's about documenting and celebrating those communications. **QSL** (from the Q-code meaning "I confirm receipt") represents the tradition of proving that a radio contact actually occurred between two stations.

Historically, QSL cards were physical postcards exchanged between operators to confirm a specific contact. These cards typically included critical information like call signs, date, time, frequency, mode of transmission, and signal reports. Collectors would often display these cards as proof of their worldwide communications and use them to earn various awards.

Modern technology has expanded QSL methods beyond physical cards to include sophisticated digital logging systems that provide instant, verifiable electronic records of radio contacts.

### Why Contact Verification Matters

Contact verification serves multiple purposes in amateur radio:
- Confirming successful communication for personal records
- Tracking achievements like DXCC (worked countries) awards
- Providing historical documentation of radio communications
- Supporting contests and specialized operating achievements

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Legitimate Contact Verification Methods:
- **Physical QSL Cards**: Detailed postcards with contact information
- **Logbook of the World (LOTW)**: Official digital logging system
- **eQSL**: Electronic QSL card platform
- **Club Log**: Online logging and confirmation system

### ❌ Invalid Verification Methods:
- **Personal emails**: Not radio-based communication
- **Text messages**: Not related to radio transmission
- **Handwritten letters**: Lack official radio contact verification standards
- **Social media messages**: Not connected to actual radio contact

## Practical Applications

### For Award Hunters:
1. **Keep Detailed Logs**: Record every contact with precise information
2. **Use Multiple Verification Systems**: Don't rely on just one method
3. **Understand Award Requirements**: Different awards may require specific verification methods

### For Different Operating Styles:
1. **DX Operators**: Collect QSL cards as proof of international contacts
2. **Contest Participants**: Use digital logging for rapid, accurate record-keeping
3. **Casual Operators**: Maintain personal logs for tracking communications
