question: "What voltage and capacity will you achieve by connecting two 12 volts, 20 ampere-hour batteries in series?"
answers:
  - text: "24 volts, 20 ampere-hours"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When batteries are connected in series, their voltages add together while their ampere-hour capacity remains unchanged. By connecting two 12V batteries in series, the total voltage becomes 24V (12V + 12V), and the total capacity remains 20 ampere-hours. This configuration is often used in amateur radio to create higher voltage power supplies while maintaining the same total energy storage capacity."
  - text: "24 volts, 40 ampere-hours"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the voltage increases to 24V in a series connection, the ampere-hour capacity does not double. Series connections combine voltage, not capacity. The total capacity remains the same as a single battery's rating, which is 20 ampere-hours."
  - text: "12 volts, 40 ampere-hours"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This configuration would result from batteries connected in parallel, not series. Series connections increase voltage, not battery capacity. The voltage would remain at 12V, and the capacity would not change from the original 20 ampere-hours."
  - text: "6 volts, 80 ampere-hours"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This scenario does not match the characteristics of series battery connection. Connecting batteries in series increases voltage, not reduces it, and does not increase the total ampere-hour capacity to 80 ampere-hours."

# Battery Connections in Amateur Radio: Understanding Series Configurations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How battery connections affect voltage and capacity
- The difference between series and parallel battery configurations
- Practical applications of battery connections in amateur radio
- Basic electrical principles of battery combinations

## The Concept: Battery Series Connections

Batteries connected in series combine their voltages while maintaining the same ampere-hour capacity. This means each battery's voltage is added together, creating a higher total voltage, but the total energy storage capacity remains unchanged.

The fundamental principle is similar to connecting water pipes end-to-end: each segment adds to the total pressure (voltage) while the total water flow (capacity) remains consistent. In electrical terms, series connections stack voltage potential while preserving the original energy storage capabilities.

### Series Connection Mathematics

When connecting batteries in series:
- **Voltage**: Add the individual battery voltages
- **Capacity**: Remains the same as a single battery
- **Total Energy**: Determined by the original battery's capacity

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Series Battery Configurations:
- **12V + 12V = 24V Portable Power**: Creating higher voltage for radio equipment
- **Emergency Communication Setups**: Using multiple batteries to extend operational time
- **Portable Repeater Power Systems**: Combining batteries for increased voltage and consistent capacity

### ❌ Incorrect Battery Connection Assumptions:
- **Thinking Capacity Increases**: Series connections do not multiply battery capacity
- **Mixing Battery Types**: Always use batteries of the same type and age in series
- **Ignoring Voltage Requirements**: Not matching equipment's voltage needs precisely

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Portable Field Day Operations**: Creating 24V power supplies from 12V batteries
2. **Emergency Communications**: Reliable power configurations for extended communications
3. **Mobile Station Power**: Adapting battery configurations to specific equipment needs

### Battery Connection Best Practices:
1. Use batteries of identical voltage and capacity
2. Ensure proper connecting hardware
3. Monitor battery health and age
4. Use appropriate fusing and protection circuits

### Memory Aid:
"**V**oltage **A**dds, **C**apacity **S**tays" - In series connections, Voltage Adds, Capacity Stays the same.
