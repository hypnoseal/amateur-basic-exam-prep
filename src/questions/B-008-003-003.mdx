question: "If your transmitter sends signals outside the band where it is transmitting, what is this called?"
answers:
  - text: "Spurious emissions"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Spurious emissions are unintended electromagnetic signals produced by a transmitter outside its intended operating frequency band. These can occur due to harmonics, intermodulation products, or imperfections in the transmitter's circuitry. Such emissions are strictly regulated because they can cause interference with other radio services and violate amateur radio technical standards."
  - text: "Side tones"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Side tones are audio feedback signals heard in a radio operator's headset or speaker that confirm a transmission is being made. They are an intentional monitoring feature, typically used in CW (Morse code) operations, and do not relate to unwanted signals outside the operating frequency band."
  - text: "Transmitter chirping"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Transmitter chirping refers to a specific problem where a transmitter's frequency fluctuates slightly during transmission, causing an audible frequency shift. While this is an undesirable characteristic, it is not the technical term for signals sent outside the intended transmission band."
  - text: "Off-frequency emissions"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this term sounds similar, it is not the standard technical term used to describe signals sent outside the transmitter's intended frequency band. Spurious emissions have a specific technical definition in radio communications regulations."

## The Concept: Spurious Emissions and Electromagnetic Leakage

Spurious emissions are unintended electromagnetic signals that are generated by a transmitter outside its authorized frequency band. These signals are essentially "radio noise" that can leak out of your transmitter through various technical imperfections in the electronic circuitry.

Imagine your radio transmitter as a precision musical instrument. Just as a violin might produce some background vibrations beyond the notes being played, a radio transmitter can generate electromagnetic signals beyond its intended frequency. These unwanted signals can potentially interfere with other radio communications, causing disruption and potentially violating regulatory standards.

### Sources of Spurious Emissions

Spurious emissions can originate from several technical sources:
- **Harmonic Distortion**: Integer multiples of the fundamental transmission frequency
- **Intermodulation Products**: Unintended signals created when multiple frequencies interact
- **Circuit Non-Linearities**: Imperfections in electronic components that create additional frequency components
- **Power Supply Noise**: Electrical interference introduced through power distribution

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Emission Control:
- **Well-Designed Transmitter**: Modern transceivers with advanced filtering that minimize spurious signals
- **Filtered Amplifier Stages**: Circuits that suppress unwanted frequency generation
- **Proper Grounding**: Techniques that reduce electromagnetic interference paths

### ❌ Poor Emission Control:
- **Older Tube Transmitters**: Higher likelihood of generating significant spurious emissions
- **Homebrew Equipment**: Higher risk of uncontrolled frequency generation
- **Poorly Maintained Transmitters**: Degraded components that increase unwanted signal production

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Regular Equipment Maintenance**: Keep transmitters clean and properly aligned
2. **Use Modern Transceivers**: Choose equipment with advanced filtering technologies
3. **Periodic Technical Checks**: Use spectrum analyzers to verify emission profiles

### Emission Reduction Strategies:
1. **Low-Pass Filtering**: Install filters to suppress harmonics
2. **Proper Impedance Matching**: Reduce signal reflections that can cause spurious emissions
3. **Careful Amplifier Design**: Use techniques that minimize non-linear signal generation
