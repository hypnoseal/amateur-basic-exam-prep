question: "If the current flowing through a 50-ohm resistor is 0.44 amperes, what voltage would you measure across the resistor?"
answers:
  - text: "22 volts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), the voltage can be calculated by multiplying the current (0.44 A) by the resistance (50 Ω). The calculation is 0.44 A × 50 Ω = 22 volts. This demonstrates the direct relationship between current, resistance, and voltage in electrical circuits."
  - text: "222 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is ten times the correct voltage and would require a current of 4.44 amperes through the same 50-ohm resistor. The calculated voltage does not match the given current of 0.44 amperes."
  - text: "2.2 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage is too low and would result from a much smaller current (0.044 amperes) flowing through the 50-ohm resistor, not the 0.44 amperes specified in the problem."
  - text: "0.22 volts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This voltage is significantly lower than what would be produced by 0.44 amperes flowing through a 50-ohm resistor. It would correspond to a much smaller current of 0.0044 amperes."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Electrical Relationships

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The law states that voltage equals current multiplied by resistance: V = I × R. This simple equation forms the backbone of understanding electrical circuits in amateur radio and electronics.

In practical terms, Ohm's Law helps you understand how electrical energy flows through a circuit. Voltage is like the pressure pushing electrical current through a resistor, current is the flow of electrons, and resistance is the obstacle that controls how easily those electrons can move.

### The Mathematical Connection

The three forms of Ohm's Law allow you to calculate any of the three values if you know the other two:
- V = I × R (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
- I = V ÷ R (Current = Voltage ÷ Resistance)
- R = V ÷ I (Resistance = Voltage ÷ Current)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Ohm's Law Calculations:
- **50Ω Resistor, 0.44A**: Voltage = 0.44 A × 50 Ω = 22 volts
- **100Ω Resistor, 2A**: Voltage = 2 A × 100 Ω = 200 volts
- **12Ω Resistor, 3A**: Voltage = 3 A × 12 Ω = 36 volts

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Forgetting Units**: Always include electrical units in your calculations
- **Misreading Decimal Points**: Careful placement of decimal points is crucial
- **Mixing Up Variables**: Always confirm which values you know and which you're solving for
