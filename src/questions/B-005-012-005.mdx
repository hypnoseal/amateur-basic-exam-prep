question: "When a parallel coil-capacitor combination is supplied with AC of different frequencies, there will be one frequency where the impedance will be highest. This is the:"
answers:
  - text: "resonant frequency"
    correct: true
    explanation: "At the resonant frequency, the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out exactly, resulting in the highest overall impedance in a parallel LC circuit. This occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, causing the circuit to present maximum impedance to the applied AC signal."
  - text: "maximum frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Maximum frequency is not a specific electrical characteristic of LC circuits. This term does not describe the unique impedance behavior of parallel resonant circuits and has no precise meaning in the context of circuit analysis."
  - text: "inductive frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Inductive frequency is not a standard technical term. While inductors do have frequency-dependent characteristics, this phrase does not accurately describe the specific behavior of parallel resonant circuits or their impedance properties."
  - text: "reactive frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Reactive frequency is not a recognized electrical engineering term. While reactance changes with frequency, this term does not specifically describe the unique impedance behavior that occurs at the resonant frequency of a parallel LC circuit."

## The Concept: Resonance in Parallel LC Circuits

Resonance is a fundamental phenomenon in electrical engineering where an alternating current circuit experiences a unique condition of maximum impedance. In a parallel combination of an inductor and capacitor, this occurs at a specific frequency where the inductive and capacitive reactances perfectly balance each other.

At the resonant frequency, the inductor and capacitor create an almost infinite impedance path, meaning the circuit becomes extremely resistant to current flow. This happens because the reactive components cancel each other out precisely, leaving a path of maximum electrical resistance.

### The Mathematical Dance of Reactance

The resonant frequency (f) is calculated using the formula: f = 1 / (2π√(LC)), where:
- L is the inductance in henries
- C is the capacitance in farads
- π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)

This formula shows how the physical characteristics of the inductor and capacitor determine the exact frequency at which resonance occurs.
