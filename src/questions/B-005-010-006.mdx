question: "What circuit parameter change causes an inductor's reactance to increase?"
answers:
  - text: "An increase in frequency"
    correct: true
    explanation: "As frequency increases, an inductor's reactance (XL) increases proportionally according to the formula XL = 2πfL, where f is frequency and L is inductance. This means higher frequencies create greater opposition to current flow through an inductor, causing the reactance to rise linearly with frequency. The increasing magnetic field interactions at higher frequencies create more electromagnetic impedance."
  - text: "A decrease in frequency"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A decrease in frequency actually reduces an inductor's reactance. Lower frequencies result in smaller magnetic field changes, which means less opposition to current flow. As frequency drops, the inductor becomes more 'transparent' to the electrical signal, reducing its reactance."
  - text: "An increase in current"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Current changes do not directly affect an inductor's reactance. Reactance is a function of frequency and inductance, not current magnitude. While current can affect other inductor characteristics like heating, it does not change the inductor's opposition to current flow at a given frequency."
  - text: "An increase in voltage"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Voltage changes do not modify an inductor's reactance. Reactance is determined by frequency and inductance, not voltage level. While voltage can influence current flow, it does not directly alter the inductor's inherent electromagnetic properties that create reactance."

## The Concept: Inductive Reactance and Frequency

An inductor is an electronic component that resists changes in current by creating a magnetic field. **Inductive reactance** (XL) represents the opposition an inductor provides to alternating current (AC) flow. Unlike resistance, which remains constant, reactance changes with frequency.

The fundamental relationship is described by the formula: XL = 2πfL
- XL: Inductive reactance (in ohms, Ω)
- π: Mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159)
- f: Frequency (in Hertz, Hz)
- L: Inductance (in Henries, H)

As frequency increases, the inductor creates a stronger opposing electromagnetic effect, causing higher reactance. Imagine a magnetic field trying to push against changing electrical currents - at higher frequencies, this "pushing" becomes more aggressive and resistive.

### Electromagnetic Interaction Principles

Inductors work by converting electrical energy into magnetic energy and back. When current flows, a magnetic field is created. As frequency increases, the magnetic field must rapidly expand and collapse, creating more electromagnetic resistance to current flow.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Frequency-Reactance Relationships:
- **Audio Crossover Networks**: Speakers use inductors to filter low frequencies
- **RF Filters**: High-frequency radio circuits use inductors to block unwanted signals
- **Power Supply Design**: Inductors smooth out voltage fluctuations differently at various frequencies

### ❌ Misconceptions About Reactance:
- **Current Doesn't Change Reactance**: Increasing current doesn't modify the inductor's opposition
- **Voltage Doesn't Alter Reactance**: Changing voltage doesn't directly impact electromagnetic resistance
- **Constant Resistance Myth**: Reactance is not the same as fixed electrical resistance

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Design:

3. **Impedance Matching**: Understand how frequency affects circuit behavior

### For Amateur Radio:
1. **Antenna Tuning**: Recognize how frequency impacts antenna impedance
2. **RF Circuit Design**: Understand reactive components in transmission systems
3. **Interference Mitigation**: Use reactive elements to manage unwanted signals

### Memory Aid:
"**F**requency **U**p, **R**eactance **U**p" - As Frequency goes Up, Reactance goes Up
