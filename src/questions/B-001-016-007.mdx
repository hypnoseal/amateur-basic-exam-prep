question: "In which of the following amateur radio bands is single sideband prohibited?"
answers:
  - text: "10.100 MHz to 10.150 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In this specific portion of the 30-meter band (10.100-10.150 MHz), CW (Continuous Wave) and digital modes are permitted, but single sideband (SSB) transmissions are prohibited. This segment is specifically reserved for narrow-bandwidth digital and Morse code communications to minimize interference and preserve the traditional character of this amateur radio band."
  - text: "18.068 MHz to 18.168 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 17-meter band (18.068-18.168 MHz) allows single sideband transmissions along with other modes. This band is fully authorized for SSB voice communications with standard power limits for amateur radio operators."
  - text: "24.890 MHz to 24.990 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 12-meter band (24.890-24.990 MHz) permits single sideband transmissions. This band is fully open for SSB voice and other authorized amateur radio communication modes."
  - text: "7.000 MHz to 7.300 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 40-meter band (7.000-7.300 MHz) allows single sideband transmissions and is a popular band for voice communications. SSB is fully permitted throughout this frequency range."

# Understanding Amateur Radio Band Mode Restrictions: The Case of 30-Meter SSB Prohibition

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The unique regulatory characteristics of the 30-meter amateur radio band
- Why certain frequency segments have specific mode restrictions
- The importance of mode-specific band allocations in amateur radio
- How international regulations influence amateur radio band usage

## The Concept: Frequency-Specific Mode Restrictions

Amateur radio bands are not uniform in their operational permissions. Each band segment can have specific mode restrictions designed to manage spectrum efficiency, minimize interference, and preserve traditional operating practices. The 30-meter band (10 MHz) is a particularly interesting example of these nuanced regulations.

The 10.100-10.150 MHz segment represents a narrow slice of spectrum where single sideband (SSB) transmissions are specifically prohibited. This restriction reflects the band's historical development and the amateur radio community's commitment to preserving certain communication traditions, particularly for narrow-bandwidth digital and Morse code (CW) communications.

### Why Mode Restrictions Matter

Mode restrictions aren't arbitrary—they're carefully considered regulatory decisions that balance:
- Spectrum efficiency
- Interference prevention
- Preservation of different communication technologies
- International coordination of radio spectrum use

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Authorized Modes in 10.100-10.150 MHz:
- **CW (Continuous Wave) Morse Code**: Primary authorized mode
- **Narrow-bandwidth Digital Modes**: Such as PSK31, RTTY
- **Experimental Narrow-band Modes**: Typically low-power, low-bandwidth communications

### ❌ Prohibited Modes in This Segment:
- **Single Sideband (SSB)**: Not permitted
- **Wide-bandwidth Digital Modes**: Would violate segment's narrow-bandwidth intent
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**: Not authorized in this specific segment

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Frequency Awareness**: Always check specific band segment regulations before transmitting
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose communication modes compatible with specific band segments
3. **Spectrum Respect**: Understand that different segments have unique operational guidelines

### For Different Operating Scenarios:
1. **Contesting**: Ensure mode selections comply with specific band segment rules
2. **Digital Communications**: Use appropriate narrow-bandwidth modes in restricted segments
3. **International Operations**: Recognize that mode restrictions can vary by country and region

### Memory Aid:
"**30M CW & Digital, No SSB**" - Remember the 30-meter band's unique mode restrictions!
