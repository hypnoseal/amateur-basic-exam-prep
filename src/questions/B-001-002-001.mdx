question: "What must you do within 30 days of a mailing address change?"
answers:
  - text: "Inform Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
    correct: true
    explanation: "As the licensing authority for amateur radio in Canada, ISED requires all licensed amateur radio operators to maintain current contact information. This ensures that ISED can communicate important regulatory updates, contact the license holder in case of interference investigations, or send official communications directly to the correct address. Failure to update your address within 30 days can potentially result in administrative penalties or license suspension."
  - text: "Inform your local amateur radio club"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While keeping your local amateur radio club informed is a good practice for community networking, it is not a legal requirement for maintaining your amateur radio license. Only ISED, as the official government licensing authority, requires mandatory address updates within the specified 30-day window."
  - text: "Inform an accredited examiner"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Accredited examiners are responsible for administering amateur radio licensing exams, not maintaining license records. They do not have the authority or responsibility to update your contact information with the licensing agency. Only ISED can officially update your license details."
  - text: "Inform Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC)"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While RAC is a valuable national amateur radio organization that provides support and advocacy, it is not the official licensing authority. RAC is a non-governmental organization and does not have the legal mandate to maintain or update amateur radio license information. Only ISED can officially process address changes for licensed operators."

## The Concept: License Administration and Contact Information

Amateur radio licensing in Canada is a formal regulatory process managed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED). When you receive an amateur radio license, you enter into a legal agreement that includes maintaining current and accurate contact information. This requirement ensures that the government can communicate directly with license holders about regulatory matters, potential interference issues, or emergency communications coordination.

The 30-day address change notification is not just a bureaucratic formality—it's a critical component of responsible amateur radio operation. By promptly updating your address, you demonstrate your commitment to maintaining the professional standards of the amateur radio service and ensuring effective communication with the licensing authority.

### Why Address Updates Matter

Keeping your contact information current serves several important purposes:
- Enables ISED to send official communications about licensing
- Allows for quick contact in case of radio interference investigations
- Maintains the integrity of the amateur radio licensing system
- Ensures you receive important regulatory updates and notices

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Address Change Procedures:
- **Online Update**: Using ISED's online amateur radio licensing portal to modify your contact information
- **Written Notification**: Sending a formal written address change request to ISED
- **Proactive Communication**: Updating your address before the 30-day window expires

### ❌ Incorrect Address Change Approaches:
- **Verbal Notification**: Telling an ISED employee at a hamfest or conference is not an official update
- **Third-Party Updates**: Asking a friend or club member to relay your address change
- **Ignoring the Requirement**: Assuming ISED will somehow learn of your address change
