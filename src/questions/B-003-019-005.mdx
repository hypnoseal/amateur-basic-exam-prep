question: "You need to work on a power supply that has been taken offline. What is the first thing you should do once the cabinet is open?"
answers:
  - text: "Discharge the filter capacitors"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Large electrolytic capacitors in power supplies can retain significant electrical charge even after the power supply is disconnected. These capacitors can store potentially lethal voltages for hours or even days after being powered off. Discharging them before working on the circuit is critical to prevent electrical shock, which could cause serious injury or death."
  - text: "Bond the chassis to ground"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While proper grounding is important in electrical work, this is not the first immediate step when opening a power supply. Chassis bonding occurs after initial safety precautions like capacitor discharge. Attempting to ground the chassis before discharging capacitors does not eliminate the stored electrical energy that poses an immediate shock hazard."
  - text: "Place the unit on an insulating mat"
    correct: false
    explanation: "An insulating mat provides workplace protection but does not address the primary safety concern of stored electrical charge in the power supply's capacitors. While using an insulating mat is a good practice, it does not eliminate the immediate risk of electrical shock from charged capacitors."
  - text: "Short the AC input leads together"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Shorting AC input leads is not a safe method of discharging capacitors and could potentially cause additional hazards. This action does not effectively discharge the DC filter capacitors that store dangerous voltage in the power supply's internal circuitry."

## The Concept: Stored Electrical Energy in Capacitors

Capacitors are electronic components designed to store electrical energy. In power supplies, large electrolytic capacitors act as filters, smoothing out voltage fluctuations and providing a steady DC voltage. These capacitors can retain significant electrical charge even after the power supply is disconnected from its power source.

A typical power supply capacitor might store hundreds of volts, capable of delivering a potentially fatal electrical shock long after the equipment appears to be powered off. The energy stored in these capacitors doesn't dissipate instantly when power is removed, making them a hidden but serious safety hazard for technicians and hobbyists.

### The Physics of Capacitor Discharge

When a power supply is disconnected, its capacitors don't immediately become safe. The electrical energy is stored in an electrostatic field between the capacitor's plates, which can maintain its charge for extended periods. This stored energy doesn't depend on continuous power input but on the capacitor's inherent electrical properties.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Capacitor Discharge Procedures:
- **Using a Discharge Tool**: Connecting a high-wattage resistor across capacitor terminals to safely bleed stored charge
- **Multimeter Discharge Method**: Carefully using a multimeter with test leads to provide a controlled discharge path
- **Manufacturer-Recommended Discharge Techniques**: Following specific guidelines for the particular power supply design

### ❌ Dangerous Capacitor Handling Methods:
- **Touching Capacitor Terminals Directly**: Risking immediate electrical shock
- **Assuming Capacitors Are Discharged**: Failing to verify voltage with proper measurement tools
- **Using Inappropriate Discharge Methods**: Risking equipment damage or personal injury
