question: "In a basic three-stage CW transmitter, what does the key do?"
answers:
  - text: "It controls the amplitude of the carrier"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a basic three-stage CW transmitter, the key acts as an electronic switch that controls the transmitter's final amplifier stage, effectively turning the RF power output on and off to create Morse code dots and dashes. By controlling the amplitude of the carrier, the key allows the operator to modulate the signal between fully powered transmission and no transmission, which is the fundamental principle of Continuous Wave (CW) communication."
  - text: "It switches the oscillator on and off"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because in a properly designed CW transmitter, the oscillator continues to run continuously to maintain frequency stability. Only the final amplifier stage is switched on and off by the key, ensuring a consistent and stable signal frequency during transmission."
  - text: "It reduces key clicks"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While key clicks can be a problem in CW transmission, reducing them is not the primary function of the key. Key clicks are actually addressed through techniques like soft keying or using shaping circuits, which gradually ramp the signal up and down to minimize sharp transitions that cause interference."
  - text: "It reduces key chirps"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Reducing key chirps is a separate issue related to frequency stability during keying, typically addressed through circuit design and stabilization techniques. The key's primary function is to control the transmitter's output power, not to prevent frequency variations during transmission."

## The Concept: Amplitude Control in CW Transmission

Continuous Wave (CW) communication is the oldest form of radio transmission, where information is sent by turning a carrier signal on and off using Morse code. In a basic three-stage CW transmitter, the key plays a critical role in controlling the amplitude of the carrier signal, effectively creating the dots and dashes of Morse code.

The transmitter typically consists of three main stages:
1. **Oscillator Stage**: Generates a stable, consistent frequency
2. **Intermediate Amplification Stage**: Provides initial signal amplification
3. **Final Amplification Stage**: Produces the transmitter's full output power

The key is strategically placed to control the final amplification stage, allowing the operator to switch the full power output on and off rapidly and precisely.

### Why Amplitude Control Matters

By controlling the amplitude (power output) rather than the oscillator itself, the transmitter maintains frequency stability. This means the signal's frequency remains constant while the power is modulated, which is crucial for clear, precise Morse code communication.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Key Functionality:
- **Precise Dot and Dash Creation**: Rapidly switching full power on and off to generate Morse code characters
- **Consistent Frequency Maintenance**: Oscillator continues running while only power output is interrupted
- **Clean Signal Transmission**: Allowing full power output when key is pressed, zero output when released

### ❌ Incorrect Keying Approaches:
- **Stopping the Oscillator**: Would cause frequency instability and poor signal quality
- **Partial Power Reduction**: Fails to create clear, distinguishable dots and dashes
- **Uncontrolled Switching**: Generates unwanted key clicks and interference

## Practical Applications

### For CW Operators:
1. **Timing Control**: The key allows precise control of dot and dash lengths
2. **Power Management**: Ensures full power is only used during actual transmission
3. **Interference Minimization**: Proper keying helps reduce unnecessary signal radiation

### For Transmitter Design:
1. **Solid-State Switching**: Modern transmitters use electronic switches for smooth, reliable keying
2. **Side-Tone Generation**: Many rigs produce an audible tone when the key is pressed, helping operators maintain rhythm
3. **Keying Speed Flexibility**: Allows operators to adjust transmission speed dynamically
