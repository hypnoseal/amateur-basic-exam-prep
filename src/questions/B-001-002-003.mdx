question: "Whenever a change of address is made:"
answers:
  - text: "you must notify Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada within 30 days of a change of mailing address"
    correct: true
    explanation: "According to Canadian amateur radio regulations, licensees are legally required to notify ISED within 30 days of changing their mailing address. This requirement ensures that ISED can maintain accurate contact information for all licensed amateur radio operators, which is critical for emergency communications, license administration, and regulatory compliance. Failure to update your address can potentially result in administrative penalties or license complications."
  - text: "you must notify Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada within 14 days of operation at the new address"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is incorrect. The regulation specifies 30 days for address notification, not 14 days. While prompt notification is important, the precise regulatory requirement is a 30-day window for updating contact information with ISED, not 14 days and not tied specifically to the start of operations at a new address."
  - text: "you must not operate until a change of address card is forwarded to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is an incorrect interpretation of the regulations. Amateur radio operators do not lose their operating privileges while waiting for an address change to be processed. They are required to notify ISED within 30 days, but can continue to operate legally during and after the address change."
  - text: "within the same province, you do not need to notify Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This statement is false. The requirement to notify ISED of an address change applies regardless of whether you are moving within the same province or to a different province. Every change of mailing address must be reported within 30 days, without exception based on geographic location."

## The Concept: Regulatory Communication and Operator Responsibility

Amateur radio is a regulated service where communication and accountability are paramount. The requirement to notify ISED within 30 days of a mailing address change is more than just a bureaucratic procedure—it's a fundamental aspect of maintaining the integrity and safety of the amateur radio service.

Your mailing address is the primary method by which ISED can contact you regarding your license, potential interference issues, regulatory updates, or emergency communications scenarios. By ensuring your contact information is current, you're participating in the responsible management of the amateur radio spectrum and maintaining the professional standards of the service.

### Why Accurate Contact Information Matters

Beyond simple administrative tracking, up-to-date contact information serves critical functions:
- Emergency communication coordination
- License administration and renewal
- Potential interference investigation
- Regulatory compliance and communication

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Address Change Procedures:
- **Moving Within City**: Notify ISED within 30 days, even if you're just moving across town
- **Interprovincial Move**: Same 30-day notification applies, regardless of provincial boundaries
- **Temporary vs. Permanent Move**: The 30-day rule applies to permanent address changes

### ❌ Incorrect Address Change Approaches:
- **Ignoring Notification**: Failing to update ISED within 30 days
- **Assuming Local Move Doesn't Matter**: Thinking moves within the same area don't require reporting
- **Waiting for License Renewal**: Delaying address update until next renewal cycle

## Practical Applications

### Address Change Tracking:
1. **Set a Reminder**: Mark your calendar for 30 days after your move
2. **Gather Documentation**: Have your new address and license information ready
