question: "A step-up transformer with a primary to secondary turns ratio of 1:5 delivers 50 milliamperes to a load. Assuming 100% efficiency, what is the primary current?"
answers:
  - text: "250 mA"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a transformer with a 1:5 turns ratio and 100% efficiency, the current and voltage relationships are inversely proportional to the turns ratio. If the secondary current is 50 mA, the primary current must be 5 times larger at 250 mA to maintain power conservation. This follows the fundamental principle of energy conservation in transformers, where the power input equals the power output."
  - text: "2500 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current is far too high and would violate the energy conservation principle. The primary current should be proportional to the turns ratio and secondary current, not 50 times larger."
  - text: "10 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current is too low and does not correctly reflect the inverse relationship between turns ratio and current in a transformer. It would not provide the necessary power to deliver 50 mA to the secondary side."
  - text: "0.25 mA"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current is far too small and would not provide enough power to the secondary side of the transformer. It incorrectly interprets the turns ratio relationship between primary and secondary currents."

## The Concept: Transformer Current Relationships

A transformer is an electromagnetic device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits through magnetic coupling. The fundamental principle governing transformer operation is that while voltage and current change between the primary and secondary windings, the total power remains constant (in an ideal, 100% efficient system).

The turns ratio of a transformer determines how voltage and current are transformed between its primary and secondary windings. When the secondary has more turns than the primary (a step-up transformer), the voltage increases while the current decreases proportionally. Conversely, the current in the primary and secondary windings are inversely related to the turns ratio.

### Mathematical Relationship
If a transformer has a turns ratio of N (secondary turns : primary turns), then:
- Voltage is multiplied by N
- Current is divided by N
- Power remains constant (excluding real-world inefficiencies)

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Transformer Current Calculations:
- **1:5 Turns Ratio**: Primary current = 250 mA when secondary current is 50 mA
- **1:2 Turns Ratio**: Secondary current would be half the primary current
- **5:1 Turns Ratio**: Secondary current would be five times the primary current

### ❌ Incorrect Transformer Assumptions:
- Assuming current remains constant across transformer windings
- Ignoring the inverse relationship between turns ratio and current
- Failing to account for energy conservation principles

## Practical Applications

### For Electronics Design:
1. **Power Supply Transformation**: Stepping voltage up or down while managing current flow
2. **Signal Isolation**: Creating electrical separation between circuits while maintaining power transfer
3. **Impedance Matching**: Adapting current and voltage for optimal power transfer

### For Amateur Radio Equipment:
1. **Audio Transformers**: Matching microphone impedance to radio input stages
2. **RF Matching Networks**: Transforming impedance for optimal antenna coupling
3. **Power Supply Design**: Creating multiple voltage rails from a single power source

### Memory Aid:
"**T**urns **U**p, **C**urrent **D**own" - When turns go Up, Current goes Down
