question: "Key clicks, heard from a Morse code transmitter at a distant receiver, are the result of:"
answers:
  - text: "too sharp rise and decay times of the keyed carrier"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Key clicks occur when the radio frequency carrier is switched on and off too abruptly, creating rapid voltage transitions that generate harmonic-rich spurious emissions. These sharp transitions produce unwanted frequency components that sound like sharp 'clicks' in a receiver, spreading the signal beyond its intended bandwidth and potentially causing interference to nearby stations."
  - text: "power supply hum modulating the carrier"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power supply hum typically produces a low-frequency noise or buzz, not sharp key clicks. While power supply issues can cause audio distortion, they do not directly create the sharp, high-frequency transients associated with key clicks in Morse code transmission."
  - text: "sparks emitting RF from the key contacts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While mechanical key contacts can generate small sparks, modern solid-state keying circuits prevent this. Key clicks are an electronic phenomenon related to signal switching characteristics, not physical sparking at the key contacts."
  - text: "changes in oscillator frequency on keying"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Frequency changes during keying can cause frequency modulation, but they do not directly produce the sharp, broadband interference characteristic of key clicks. Key clicks are primarily a result of amplitude switching characteristics, not frequency variations."

## The Concept: Signal Transitions and Harmonic Generation

In Morse code transmission, **key clicks** are unwanted, sharp audio artifacts heard at distant receivers when a radio signal is switched on and off too abruptly. These clicks result from rapid voltage transitions that create harmonic-rich spurious emissions, effectively spreading the signal's energy across a broader frequency spectrum than intended.

Think of signal switching like turning a light on and off. A smooth, gradual transition (like a dimmer switch) creates minimal electromagnetic disturbance. In contrast, an instantaneous on/off creates a sharp "pop" of energy—in radio terms, this translates to harmonic emissions that can interfere with nearby communications.

### The Physics of Sharp Transitions

When a radio frequency carrier is switched too quickly, the sudden voltage change creates high-frequency harmonic components. These harmonics can:
- Spread beyond the allocated amateur radio band
- Cause interference to nearby stations
- Violate spectral purity regulations
- Reduce overall communication effectiveness

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Clean Signal Switching Methods:
- **Soft Keying**: Using electronic circuits that gradually ramp signal amplitude
- **Rise Time Management**: Controlling signal transition speed to minimize harmonics
- **Low-Pass Filtering**: Implementing additional filtering to smooth signal edges

### ❌ Poor Keying Practices:
- **Direct On/Off Switching**: Creates sharp, click-producing transitions
- **Unfiltered Mechanical Keys**: Can generate additional spurious emissions
- **High-Speed Keying Without Proper Circuitry**: Increases harmonic generation

## Practical Applications

### For CW Operators:
1. **Use Keyers with Rise Time Control**: Modern electronic keyers can shape signal transitions
2. **Implement Low-Pass Filtering**: Additional filtering at the transmitter output reduces harmonics
3. **Monitor Signal Quality**: Use spectrum analyzers or receiver reports to check signal purity

### Technical Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Exponential Rise/Decay Curves**: Shape the signal transition to minimize sharp edges
2. **Series Resistance Keying**: Add resistance to smooth key transitions
3. **RF Switching Techniques**: Use techniques that minimize instantaneous voltage changes

### Memory Aid:
"**S**mooth **S**witching **S**tops **S**purious" - Gradual signal transitions prevent key clicks.
