question: "Which of the following amateur radio bands has a maximum allowed bandwidth of less than 6 kHz?"
answers:
  - text: "10.100 MHz to 10.150 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The 30-meter band (10.100-10.150 MHz) is a narrow-band allocation primarily used for digital modes and narrow-bandwidth communication like CW (Continuous Wave) and PSK31. The International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) Region 2 band plan restricts this segment to modes with very narrow bandwidth, typically less than 500 Hz, making it uniquely constrained compared to other HF amateur bands. This makes it ideal for low-power, long-distance communication with minimal spectrum usage."
  - text: "18.068 MHz to 18.168 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 17-meter band (18.068-18.168 MHz) allows standard amateur radio communication modes with bandwidths up to 6 kHz, which does not meet the specific narrow-bandwidth requirement of the question. This band supports SSB, digital modes, and other wider-bandwidth communication techniques."
  - text: "24.890 MHz to 24.990 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 12-meter band (24.890-24.990 MHz) supports standard amateur radio communication modes with bandwidths up to 6 kHz. This band is not characterized by the extremely narrow bandwidth mentioned in the question."
  - text: "1.800 MHz to 2.000 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The 160-meter band (1.800-2.000 MHz) allows various communication modes with bandwidths that can exceed 6 kHz, particularly for SSB and digital modes. This is a broader band with more flexible bandwidth allocations."

# Narrow-Bandwidth Amateur Radio: Understanding Spectral Efficiency in the 30-Meter Band

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What determines bandwidth in amateur radio communications
- The unique characteristics of the 30-meter amateur radio band
- Why narrow-bandwidth modes are important in amateur radio
- How different frequency bands have different communication mode restrictions

## The Concept: Bandwidth and Spectral Efficiency

Bandwidth in amateur radio represents the range of frequencies occupied by a radio signal during transmission. Just like highway lanes have different width restrictions, radio bands have different bandwidth allocations that determine what types of communication can occur.

The 30-meter band (10.100-10.150 MHz) is unique among amateur radio allocations because it strongly encourages extremely narrow-bandwidth modes. This approach maximizes spectrum efficiency, allowing more simultaneous communications in a limited frequency range.

### Why Bandwidth Matters

Different communication modes require different amounts of spectrum:
- CW (Morse Code): Typically less than 500 Hz
- Digital Modes (PSK31): Around 31 Hz
- SSB Voice: Approximately 3 kHz
- Wide Digital Modes: Up to 6 kHz or more

The 30-meter band's design promotes modes that use minimal spectrum, supporting efficient, long-distance communication with low power.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Narrow-Bandwidth Communication Techniques:
- **CW (Morse Code)**: Uses extremely narrow bandwidth, perfect for 30-meter operations
- **PSK31**: Digital mode requiring minimal spectral space
- **WSPR**: Weak signal propagation reporting mode with microscopic bandwidth
- **FT8**: Narrow digital mode enabling global communication with minimal power

### ❌ Inappropriate Modes for 30-Meter Restrictions:
- **SSB Voice**: Too wide for typical 30-meter allocations
- **RTTY**: Wider digital mode that might exceed bandwidth limits
- **Packet Radio**: Can require broader spectrum than the band encourages

### For Technical Operators:
1. **Spectrum Management**: Practice using minimal bandwidth
2. **Interference Reduction**: Minimize potential interference with other services
3. **Signal-to-Noise Improvement**: Narrow modes often provide better weak-signal performance
