## The Concept: Free Access to Amateur Radio Certification

The Canadian government, through Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), supports amateur radio as a valuable public service and technical learning opportunity. As part of this support, all amateur radio qualification examinations are provided free of charge to candidates, regardless of the number of exams taken or qualification levels sought.

This policy reflects the broader value that amateur radio brings to Canadian society, including emergency communications, technical skill development, and community service. By removing financial barriers to entry, ISED encourages more Canadians to explore this technical hobby and develop valuable communication skills.

### The Broader Context of Amateur Radio Support

Amateur radio is unique among technical hobbies in its direct connection to public service. During emergencies, natural disasters, or community events, amateur radio operators provide critical communication support. The free examination policy is one way the government supports and encourages this important volunteer service.
