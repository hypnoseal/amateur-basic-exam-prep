question: "What happens to current when a series RLC circuit is tuned to the frequency of the source?"
answers:
  - text: "It reaches maximum"
    correct: true
    explanation: "At resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out exactly, leaving only the circuit's resistance to limit current flow. This creates a condition where the circuit impedance is at its minimum, allowing maximum current to flow. The circuit behaves as if it were purely resistive, enabling the highest possible current transfer from the source."
  - text: "It is limited by inductive reactance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "At resonance, inductive reactance is not the limiting factor. In fact, at the resonant frequency, the inductive reactance is precisely canceled out by the capacitive reactance, leaving only the circuit's resistance to control current flow. Inductive reactance plays a role in non-resonant conditions but becomes neutralized at the resonant frequency."
  - text: "It is limited by capacitive reactance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "At resonance, capacitive reactance is not the limiting factor. Similar to inductive reactance, the capacitive reactance is completely canceled out at the resonant frequency. The circuit's resistance becomes the only impedance controlling current flow, not the capacitive reactance."
  - text: "It reaches minimum"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. At resonance, current actually reaches its maximum, not its minimum. When the circuit is tuned to the source frequency, the reactive components (inductance and capacitance) cancel each other out, leaving the minimum possible impedance and thus the maximum possible current flow."

## Learning Objectives

## The Concept: Resonance and Current Dynamics

A series RLC circuit consists of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected sequentially. **Resonance** occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances are exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, effectively canceling each other out.

At the resonant frequency, the circuit's total impedance becomes minimal, consisting only of the circuit's resistance. This unique condition allows maximum current to flow from the source, making the circuit behave as if it were a pure resistive load.

### The Mathematical Dance of Reactance

At resonance, the following conditions are met:
- Inductive Reactance (XL) = Capacitive Reactance (XC)
- Total Reactive Impedance = 0
- Circuit Impedance = Resistance (R)
- Current Reaches Maximum Value

Mathematically, the resonant frequency (f0) is calculated by the formula: f0 = 1 / (2π√(LC))

### ❌ Non-Resonant Circuit Behaviors:
- **Below Resonance**: Capacitive reactance dominates, limiting current
- **Above Resonance**: Inductive reactance dominates, limiting current
- **At Non-Resonant Frequencies**: Reduced current flow due to reactive impedances
