question: "What is the resistance of a circuit that draws 0.25 amperes from a 12-volt source?"
answers:
  - text: "48 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), the resistance can be calculated by dividing the voltage (12V) by the current (0.25A). 12V ÷ 0.25A = 48 ohms. This calculation shows how resistance relates to the voltage applied and the current flowing through a circuit."
  - text: "3 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer would result from dividing 12V by 4A, not the given current of 0.25A. It demonstrates a misapplication of Ohm's Law or a computational error that doesn't match the provided circuit parameters."
  - text: "12 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value would be obtained by incorrectly dividing the voltage (12V) by 1A instead of the actual current of 0.25A. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how to apply Ohm's Law to calculate circuit resistance."
  - text: "0.25 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer mistakenly uses the current value (0.25A) as the resistance, showing a complete misunderstanding of Ohm's Law and how to calculate resistance in an electrical circuit."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Circuit Calculations

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The law states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with resistance being the constant of proportionality.

The basic formula is expressed as: **V = I × R**
- V (Voltage) is measured in volts (V)
- I (Current) is measured in amperes (A)
- R (Resistance) is measured in ohms (Ω)

This simple equation allows amateur radio operators to understand and calculate electrical properties in their circuits, from power supplies to antenna matching networks. By knowing any two of these three values, you can always calculate the third.

### Why This Matters in Amateur Radio

Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for:
- Designing efficient power supplies
- Matching antenna systems
- Troubleshooting circuit performance
- Preventing component damage through proper current and voltage management

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Circuit Calculations:
- **12V Source, 0.25A Current**: Resistance = 12V ÷ 0.25A = 48 ohms
- **Battery Voltage (9V), Desired Current (0.5A)**: Resistance = 9V ÷ 0.5A = 18 ohms
- **LED Circuit Design**: Calculating appropriate current-limiting resistors

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Confusing Current and Resistance**: Mistaking the current value for resistance
- **Inverting the Ohm's Law Formula**: Applying the formula incorrectly
- **Ignoring Unit Conversions**: Not matching units when performing calculations
