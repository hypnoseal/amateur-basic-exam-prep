question: "In an FM receiver, what is the purpose of the discriminator?"
answers:
  - text: "Recover the original modulation from the carrier"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The discriminator is an essential circuit in FM receivers that converts frequency variations in the received signal back into the original audio signal. It detects the frequency changes of the FM carrier and translates them into corresponding voltage variations that represent the original transmitted audio information. This process is critical for converting the frequency-modulated radio signal into a recoverable audio output."
  - text: "Select narrowband or wideband FM reception"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Bandwidth selection is typically handled by the receiver's IF (intermediate frequency) filter or detector circuit, not the discriminator. While the discriminator is involved in FM signal processing, it does not directly select the FM reception bandwidth. Bandwidth selection is usually accomplished through front-end filtering and circuit design."
  - text: "Remove amplitude modulation from the received signal"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Amplitude modulation (AM) rejection is primarily handled by the receiver's limiting amplifier stages, not the discriminator. The discriminator's primary function is to convert frequency variations into audio signals, not to remove unwanted amplitude variations. Limiters in the receiver's front-end circuitry are responsible for suppressing amplitude noise and variations."
  - text: "Provide most of the receiver's selectivity"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Receiver selectivity is determined by the IF (intermediate frequency) stages and crystal or mechanical filters, not the discriminator. The discriminator is a demodulation circuit that converts frequency variations to audio, while selectivity (the ability to reject adjacent frequencies) is a function of the receiver's front-end filtering and IF stages."

## The Concept: Frequency Modulation and Signal Recovery

Frequency modulation (FM) is a method of encoding information by varying the instantaneous frequency of a carrier wave. Unlike amplitude modulation (AM), where the signal's strength changes, FM varies the frequency around a center point to represent audio or data information.

The **discriminator** is a specialized electronic circuit that serves as the "translator" in this communication process. Its primary function is to convert these frequency variations back into the original audio or information signal. Think of it like a decoder ring that takes the complex frequency changes and turns them back into something meaningful—in this case, sound.

### The Frequency-to-Voltage Conversion Process

When an FM signal arrives at the receiver, it contains tiny frequency variations representing the original audio. The discriminator uses electronic components like tuned circuits and diodes to convert these frequency changes into proportional voltage changes. These voltage variations precisely mirror the original audio signal that was transmitted.
