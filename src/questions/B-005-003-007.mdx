question: "Which of the following two quantities should be multiplied together to find power?"
answers:
  - text: "Voltage and current"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Power is calculated by multiplying voltage (electrical pressure) by current (electron flow). This fundamental electrical equation, P = V × I, allows calculation of electrical power in watts. This relationship is crucial in understanding electrical systems, from basic circuits to complex radio equipment, and follows directly from the fundamental principles of electrical energy transfer."
  - text: "Inductance and capacitance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Inductance and capacitance are electrical properties that describe how components store and release energy in electromagnetic fields, but they do not directly calculate power. These are reactive components that influence circuit behavior, but cannot be multiplied to determine power output or consumption."
  - text: "Voltage and inductance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Voltage and inductance cannot be multiplied to determine power. Inductance is a measure of an inductor's ability to store energy in a magnetic field, while voltage is electrical potential. These quantities have different units and do not combine to calculate electrical power."
  - text: "Resistance and capacitance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Resistance and capacitance are electrical properties with different characteristics and cannot be multiplied to calculate power. Resistance determines how much a component opposes current flow, while capacitance describes a component's ability to store electrical charge, but neither directly yields power when multiplied together."

## The Concept: Power in Electrical Circuits

Power represents the rate of energy transfer or conversion in an electrical system. In amateur radio, understanding power is crucial for designing circuits, managing transmitter output, and ensuring safe equipment operation.

The fundamental equation for electrical power, P = V × I, shows that power (in watts) is determined by multiplying voltage (electrical pressure in volts) by current (electron flow in amperes). This relationship reveals how electrical energy is transferred and transformed in circuits, from simple battery-powered devices to complex radio transmission systems.

### Why Voltage and Current Matter

Voltage represents the potential difference that drives electrons through a circuit, while current represents the actual flow of those electrons. When these two quantities are multiplied, they reveal the total energy transfer occurring in the system. More voltage or more current results in more power, which is why high-power amateur radio transmitters require careful design and management.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Power Calculation Scenarios:
- **12V Battery with 2A Current**: 12V × 2A = 24 watts of power
- **Handheld Radio Transmitter**: 8V × 0.5A = 4 watts output
- **HF Base Station**: 13.8V × 20A = 276 watts of power supply capacity

### ❌ Incorrect Power Calculation Attempts:
- **Inductance × Capacitance**: Produces meaningless results with incorrect units
- **Voltage × Resistance**: Calculates electrical work, not instantaneous power
- **Current × Capacitance**: Physical nonsense that doesn't represent energy transfer
