question: "In a semiconductor diode, electrons flow from:"
answers:
  - text: "cathode to anode"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a semiconductor diode, electrons actually flow from the N-type (negative) region (cathode) to the P-type (positive) region (anode). This flow occurs due to the semiconductor's internal band structure and the forward bias condition, where electrons move from the region with excess electrons to the region with electron 'holes'. This directional flow is fundamental to the diode's ability to act as a one-way electrical valve, allowing current to pass in only one direction."
  - text: "anode to cathode"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Electrons in a semiconductor diode actually flow from the cathode (N-type region) to the anode (P-type region) when the diode is forward-biased. Reversing the direction would prevent the diode from conducting and violate the fundamental principles of semiconductor physics."
  - text: "source to drain"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This terminology describes the electron flow in a field-effect transistor (FET), not a diode. While similar in some ways, a diode and a FET are different semiconductor devices with distinct electron flow characteristics. In a diode, electrons flow from cathode to anode, not source to drain."
  - text: "base to collector"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This describes electron flow in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), specifically in an NPN transistor. This is not the correct electron flow path for a diode. In a diode, electrons move from the cathode (N-type region) to the anode (P-type region) when forward-biased."

## The Concept: Semiconductor Diode Electron Movement

A semiconductor diode is a fundamental electronic component that allows electrical current to flow in only one direction. At its core, a diode consists of two regions of semiconductor material: a P-type region (with excess positive charge carriers or "holes") and an N-type region (with excess negative charge carriers or electrons).

The movement of electrons in a diode is governed by the principles of semiconductor physics, specifically how charge carriers interact at the P-N junction. When the diode is forward-biased (connected with the correct polarity), electrons can move from the N-type region (cathode) to the P-type region (anode), creating a one-way electrical valve effect.

### Why Electron Direction Matters

Understanding electron flow is crucial in electronics because it determines how components function. In a diode, electrons move from the region with excess electrons (cathode/N-type) to the region with electron "holes" (anode/P-type), enabling current to flow in only one direction.
