question: "What is the frequency range of the 15-metre amateur radio band in Canada?"
answers:
  - text: "21.000 MHz to 21.450 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the precise 15-metre amateur radio band allocation in Canada, as defined by ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada). This frequency range provides approximately 450 kHz of spectrum for amateur radio operators to use for various communication modes, including SSB voice, CW (Morse code), digital modes, and AM/FM communications. This band is particularly known for excellent long-distance propagation characteristics during periods of high solar activity."
  - text: "18.068 MHz to 18.168 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range corresponds to the 17-metre amateur radio band, not the 15-metre band. While an important HF band, it is significantly lower in frequency than the 15-metre band and offers different propagation characteristics."
  - text: "14.000 MHz to 14.350 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is the frequency range of the 20-metre amateur radio band, one of the most popular HF bands for long-distance communication. While similar in some propagation characteristics to the 15-metre band, it operates at a lower frequency and covers a different portion of the radio spectrum."
  - text: "28.000 MHz to 29.700 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range describes the 10-metre amateur radio band, which is significantly higher in frequency than the 15-metre band. The 10-metre band is known for excellent short and long-distance communication during solar maximum periods but is not the 15-metre band."

# The 15-Metre Amateur Radio Band: Understanding VHF/HF Spectrum Allocation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The precise frequency range of the 15-metre amateur radio band
- How amateur radio bands are allocated and defined
- The unique propagation characteristics of the 15-metre band
- How band allocations relate to international radio regulations

## The Concept: Amateur Radio Band Allocation

Amateur radio bands are specific frequency ranges allocated by national and international regulatory bodies for amateur radio communication. These allocations are carefully managed to prevent interference between different radio services and to optimize spectrum usage.

The 15-metre band, centered around 21 MHz, is part of the High Frequency (HF) spectrum. It gets its name from the approximate wavelength of signals in this frequency range—about 15 metres. This band is particularly interesting because it offers excellent long-distance communication possibilities, especially during periods of high solar activity.

### Why Precise Frequency Boundaries Matter

In amateur radio, knowing the exact band limits is crucial. Operating outside these limits can:
- Cause harmful interference to other services
- Violate ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) regulations
- Risk losing your amateur radio operating privileges

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper 15-Metre Band Usage:
- **DX Contacts**: Long-distance communication across continents
- **Digital Modes**: PSK31, RTTY, and other narrow-bandwidth digital communications
- **Contests**: Competitive contacts using various communication modes

### ❌ Incorrect Band Usage:
- **Transmitting below 21.000 MHz**: Potential interference with other radio services
- **Transmitting above 21.450 MHz**: Operating outside allocated amateur radio spectrum
- **Misunderstanding Band Edges**: Risking unintentional out-of-band transmission

## Practical Applications

### For HF/VHF Operators:
1. **Propagation Prediction**: Use 15-metre band during solar maximum for excellent worldwide communications
2. **Mode Selection**: Choose appropriate communication modes within band limitations
3. **Equipment Configuration**: Set radio to stay within 21.000-21.450 MHz range

### For Different Communication Scenarios:
1. **Daytime Worldwide Communication**: Excellent for intercontinental contacts
2. **Contest Operations**: Popular band for amateur radio competitions
3. **Digital Mode Experiments**: Sufficient bandwidth for various digital communication techniques

### Memory Aid:
"**21** for **Fun**" - Remember 21.000-21.450 MHz is your 15-metre playground!
