question: "In what values are RF transmission line losses expressed?"
answers:
  - text: "Decibel per unit length"
    correct: true
    explanation: "RF transmission line losses are expressed in decibels per unit length (typically decibels per 100 meters) because decibels provide a logarithmic representation of power reduction along a transmission line. This measurement allows engineers and amateur radio operators to compare different transmission line types and understand signal attenuation across varying frequencies and line lengths."
  - text: "Ohms per MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Ohms per MHz is not a valid measurement for transmission line losses. Ohms are used to measure impedance, which describes the characteristic resistance of a transmission line, but do not represent power loss or signal attenuation over distance."
  - text: "Decibel per MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is an incorrect way to express transmission line losses. Decibel per MHz would imply loss changes with frequency, whereas actual transmission line loss is expressed per unit length, independent of frequency measurement."
  - text: "Ohms per metre"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Ohms per metre describes the transmission line's characteristic impedance (resistance per unit length), not its power loss or signal attenuation. This measurement tells you about the line's electrical properties but does not indicate how much signal strength will be reduced over distance."

## The Concept: Transmission Line Loss Measurement

In amateur radio, **transmission line losses** represent the reduction in signal power that occurs as radio frequency (RF) energy travels along a cable or transmission line. These losses are inevitable and occur due to several factors, including conductor resistance, dielectric absorption, and electromagnetic radiation.

Decibels (dB) are used to express these losses because they provide a logarithmic scale that accurately represents power reduction. Unlike linear measurements, decibels allow easy comparison between different transmission line types and frequencies, making them an ideal metric for quantifying signal attenuation.

### The Logarithmic Advantage

Imagine signal loss like walking down a gradually sloping hill. A linear measurement would show small changes, while a logarithmic scale (decibels) reveals the cumulative effect more clearly. For transmission lines, this means you can quickly understand how much signal strength decreases per unit length.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Loss Measurement:
- **RG-8U Coaxial Cable**: Might have losses of 2.5 dB per 100 meters at 146 MHz
- **Heliax Hardline**: Could have much lower losses, around 0.5 dB per 100 meters
- **Thin Coax**: Might experience higher losses, perhaps 4-5 dB per 100 meters

### ❌ Incorrect Loss Representations:
- **Ohms per MHz**: Describes impedance, not power loss
- **Raw Power Reduction**: Doesn't account for logarithmic signal behavior
- **Frequency-Independent Measurements**: Fails to recognize frequency's impact on attenuation

## Practical Applications

### For Antenna System Design:
1. **Cable Selection**: Choose transmission lines with lowest loss for your frequency and distance
2. **Length Considerations**: Understand how cable length impacts signal strength
3. **Frequency-Specific Planning**: Recognize that losses vary with operating frequency

### For Field Day and Portable Operations:
1. **Minimize Cable Runs**: Use shortest possible transmission lines
2. **Select Low-Loss Cables**: Prioritize cable types with minimal decibel loss per unit length
3. **Understand Trade-offs**: Balance cable thickness, flexibility, and loss characteristics

### Memory Aid:
