question: "What is the wavelength in free space of a 25 MHz signal?"
answers:
  - text: "12 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The wavelength is calculated using the fundamental wave equation: wavelength (λ) = speed of light (c) ÷ frequency (f). At 25 MHz, the wavelength is exactly 12 metres. By using the universal constant of light speed (3 × 10^8 m/s) and dividing by 25 × 10^6 Hz, we arrive precisely at 12 metres, confirming this as the correct free space wavelength."
  - text: "19 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This wavelength would correspond to a signal frequency of approximately 15.8 MHz, not 25 MHz. The mathematical relationship between frequency and wavelength is inverse: as frequency increases, wavelength decreases proportionally. The 19-metre suggestion misunderstands the direct calculation between frequency and wavelength."
  - text: "39 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A 39-metre wavelength would represent a much lower frequency of approximately 7.7 MHz, significantly different from the 25 MHz specified in the question. This incorrect answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the wavelength-frequency relationship."
  - text: "6 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While 6 metres is a common amateur radio band, it represents a different frequency (around 50 MHz). For a 25 MHz signal, 6 metres is too short and does not match the wave equation calculation of wavelength."

## The Concept: Wavelength and Frequency Relationship

Wavelength is a fundamental property of electromagnetic waves that describes the physical distance between successive wave peaks in free space. In amateur radio, understanding wavelength is crucial for antenna design, signal propagation prediction, and understanding radio wave behavior.

The relationship between wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) is defined by a simple yet powerful equation: λ = c/f, where c represents the speed of light (3 × 10^8 meters per second). This equation demonstrates that frequency and wavelength are inversely related - as frequency increases, wavelength decreases proportionally.

### Why Wavelength Matters in Amateur Radio

Wavelength isn't just a theoretical concept - it directly impacts how radio signals travel, how antennas are designed, and how different frequencies behave in various propagation conditions. An antenna's optimal length is typically related to the wavelength of the signal it's designed to transmit or receive.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Wavelength Calculation Demonstrations:
- **25 MHz Signal**: Wavelength = 3 × 10^8 m/s ÷ (25 × 10^6 Hz) = 12 metres
- **50 MHz Signal**: Wavelength = 3 × 10^8 m/s ÷ (50 × 10^6 Hz) = 6 metres
- **14 MHz Signal**: Wavelength = 3 × 10^8 m/s ÷ (14 × 10^6 Hz) = 21.4 metres

### ❌ Common Wavelength Calculation Mistakes:
- Forgetting to convert frequencies to standard units
- Misunderstanding the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength
- Neglecting the speed of light constant in calculations

## Practical Applications

### For Antenna Design:
1. **Dipole Antenna Length**: Half-wavelength dipoles are most efficient, so a 25 MHz antenna would be approximately 6 metres long
2. **Portable Antenna Planning**: Understanding wavelength helps in designing compact, portable antennas
3. **Multiband Antenna Strategies**: Wavelength knowledge enables creating antennas that work across multiple frequency ranges

### For Signal Propagation:
1. **Skip Distance Prediction**: Different wavelengths interact differently with the ionosphere
2. **Obstacle Penetration**: Longer wavelengths tend to diffract around obstacles more effectively
3. **Antenna Gain Calculations**: Antenna performance is directly related to wavelength

### Memory Aid:
"**F**requency **D**ivided by **C**onstant = **W**avelength" - The simple way to remember the wave equation.
