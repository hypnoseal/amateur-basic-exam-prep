question: "On resistors with four colour bands, which colour band differentiates two resistors rated at 120 ohms and 1200 ohms respectively?"
answers:
  - text: "Third"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The third color band represents the multiplier (or decimal) that determines the final resistance value. In this case, it's the difference between 120 ohms and 1200 ohms, showing how the multiplier band changes the resistor's value by shifting the decimal point."
  - text: "First"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The first color band represents the first significant digit of the resistor's value, which is the same for both 120 and 1200 ohm resistors (1), and thus cannot differentiate between these two resistance values."
  - text: "Second"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The second color band represents the second significant digit of the resistor's value. For 120 ohms and 1200 ohms, this band (2) is identical, so it cannot distinguish between these two resistance values."
  - text: "Fourth"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The fourth color band typically represents the tolerance of the resistor, which indicates the precision of the resistance value. It does not determine the base resistance value and therefore cannot differentiate between 120 and 1200 ohm resistors."

## The Concept: Resistor Color Coding

Resistor color coding is a standardized method used to indicate the electrical resistance, tolerance, and sometimes reliability of electronic resistors. For a four-band resistor, each color represents a specific piece of information about the component's electrical characteristics.

The standard four-band color code follows this pattern:
1. **First Band**: First significant digit
2. **Second Band**: Second significant digit
3. **Third Band**: Multiplier (decimal placement)
4. **Fourth Band**: Tolerance

### Resistance Value Calculation

To calculate a resistor's value, you read the first two bands as a two-digit number, then multiply by the multiplier indicated by the third band. For instance:
- 120 Ω: 1-2-×10¹
- 1200 Ω: 1-2-×10²

The key difference between these two resistors is the multiplier band, which shifts the decimal point.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Resistance Value Determination:
- **120 Ω Resistor**: Brown-Red-Brown-Gold
- **1200 Ω Resistor**: Brown-Red-Red-Gold
- **Notice the difference in the third (multiplier) band**

### ❌ Common Misinterpretation Scenarios:
- **Ignoring Multiplier**: Thinking only the first two digits matter
- **Misreading Color Sequence**: Accidentally swapping band positions
- **Overlooking Tolerance**: Assuming all bands represent resistance value
