question: "If a dial marked in megahertz shows a reading of 3.525 MHz, what would it show if it were marked in kilohertz?"
answers:
  - text: "3 525 kHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "3.525 MHz converted to kilohertz requires multiplying the megahertz value by 1,000. This is because 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz. So 3.525 × 1,000 = 3,525 kHz. The conversion maintains the same numerical value while simply changing the unit prefix from mega (M) to kilo (k)."
  - text: "35.25 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer represents dividing by 100 instead of multiplying by 1,000. The conversion from MHz to kHz requires multiplication, not division, and the full value of the original frequency must be preserved."
  - text: "3 525 000 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly multiplies by 1,000,000 instead of 1,000. While the result technically converts MHz to Hz, it drastically overinflates the original frequency and does not represent the conversion to kilohertz."
  - text: "352.5 kHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This incorrect answer results from dividing the original frequency by 10, which does not represent the correct conversion between megahertz and kilohertz."

## The Concept: Metric Prefix Conversions in Frequency Measurement

Frequency measurements in amateur radio often require converting between different metric prefixes. The metric system uses standardized prefixes that represent specific multiplicative relationships. In the case of hertz (frequency), the key prefixes are:
- 1 megahertz (MHz) = 1,000 kilohertz (kHz)
- 1 kilohertz (kHz) = 1,000 hertz (Hz)

This systematic scaling allows radio operators to work with a wide range of frequencies using consistent mathematical conversions. The conversion is always a simple multiplication or division by 1,000, maintaining the numerical precision of the original measurement.

### Why Precision Matters in Amateur Radio

Accurate frequency conversion is critical in amateur radio for:
- Precise band edge compliance
- Accurate signal reporting
- Proper equipment configuration
- Clear communication of frequency information

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Frequency Conversions:
- **14.250 MHz = 14,250 kHz**: Standard HF band frequency conversion
- **146.520 MHz = 146,520 kHz**: VHF simplex frequency conversion
- **3.525 MHz = 3,525 kHz**: Specific example from the exam question

### ❌ Common Conversion Mistakes:
- Dividing instead of multiplying
- Misplacing decimal points
- Confusing different metric prefixes
- Failing to multiply by the correct factor (1,000)

## Practical Applications

### For Frequency Measurement:
1. **Precise Logging**: Accurately recording frequencies in contest and DX communications
2. **Band Planning**: Understanding frequency allocations across different units
3. **Equipment Configuration**: Setting precise transceiver frequencies

### For Technical Communication:
1. **Consistent Reporting**: Using standard conversion methods
2. **International Communication**: Ensuring clarity across different measurement systems
3. **Technical Documentation**: Maintaining precision in frequency descriptions

### Memory Aid:
"**M**ove **3** Places **R**ight" - When converting MHz to kHz, multiply by 1,000 (move the decimal three places right)
