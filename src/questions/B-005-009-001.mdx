question: "If two equal-value inductors are connected in series, what is their total inductance?"
answers:
  - text: "Twice the value of one inductor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When inductors are connected in series, their total inductance is calculated by simply adding their individual values. For two identical inductors, this means the total inductance will be twice the value of a single inductor. This follows the same principle as adding resistors in series, where the total value is the sum of the individual component values."
  - text: "Half the value of one inductor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect for series inductor connections. In a series configuration, inductors add their values, not divide them. Half the value would occur in a parallel connection, not a series connection."
  - text: "The value of one inductor times 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is incorrect. Series inductors add their values linearly, not multiplicatively. Two inductors of equal value will result in twice their individual value, not four times."
  - text: "The value of one inductor divided by 4"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect for series inductor connections. Dividing the inductor value would occur in a parallel configuration, not a series connection. In series, inductors add their full values."

## The Concept: Inductor Series Connections

Inductance is a measure of an electrical component's ability to store energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. When inductors are connected in series, their total inductance is simply the sum of their individual inductance values. This means that if you have two identical inductors, the total inductance will be twice the value of a single inductor.

Think of inductors like water pipes that store magnetic energy. When you connect identical pipes in a straight line (series), the total volume of water they can hold doubles. Similarly, when you connect identical inductors in series, the total ability to store magnetic energy doubles.

### The Mathematical Principle

For inductors in series, the total inductance (L_total) is calculated by:
L_total = L1 + L2 + L3 + ... + Ln

Where L1, L2, etc., represent the individual inductor values. For two equal inductors, this becomes simply L_total = 2L.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Series Inductor Configurations:
- **Two 10 mH Inductors**: Total inductance will be 20 mH
- **Three 5 mH Inductors**: Total inductance will be 15 mH
- **Matching Transformer Windings**: Many RF transformers use series inductor principles

### ❌ Incorrect Series Inductor Assumptions:
- **Dividing Inductor Values**: Incorrectly assuming series inductors reduce total inductance
- **Multiplying Inductor Values**: Assuming complex multiplication rules apply
- **Ignoring Series Connection Rules**: Treating series and parallel connections as interchangeable

2. **Antenna Matching Networks**: Using series inductors to fine-tune impedance matching
3. **Filter Design**: Constructing more complex inductor-based filters by understanding series connection principles

### For Electronic Design:
1. **Impedance Matching**: Precisely controlling total circuit inductance
2. **Energy Storage**: Designing circuits with specific magnetic energy storage characteristics
3. **Noise Reduction**: Using series inductors to filter unwanted frequencies

### Memory Aid:
"**S**eries **A**dds **L**inearly" - In series, inductors add their full values.
