question: "The power of your transmitter is 100 watts and your transmission line introduces a loss of 6 dB. How much power is delivered to the antenna?"
answers:
  - text: "25 watts"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A 6 dB loss represents a power reduction by a factor of 4 (because decibels are logarithmic). When 100 watts enters a transmission line with 6 dB loss, the power is reduced from 100 watts to 25 watts at the antenna output. This follows the fundamental dB power calculation where each 3 dB represents a halving of power, so 6 dB results in a quartering of the original power."
  - text: "50 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "50 watts would represent a 3 dB loss, which is only a halving of power. In this scenario with a 6 dB loss, the power reduction is more significant, dropping to 25 watts at the antenna output."
  - text: "17 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is not mathematically consistent with a 6 dB loss from 100 watts. While close to the correct 25 watts, it does not accurately represent the power reduction introduced by a 6 dB transmission line loss."
  - text: "33 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "33 watts does not correspond to the standard power reduction calculation for a 6 dB loss. The correct reduction from 100 watts with a 6 dB loss is precisely 25 watts, representing a power reduction by a factor of 4."

## The Concept: Decibel Power Calculations

Decibels are a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio between two power levels. In amateur radio, they're crucial for understanding how transmission lines, amplifiers, and antenna systems interact. A key principle is that every 3 dB represents a power reduction by half, and every 6 dB represents a power reduction by a factor of four.

The logarithmic nature of decibels allows engineers and radio amateurs to work with wide ranges of power levels using compact, manageable numbers. When we talk about a 6 dB loss, we're describing a specific, predictable power reduction that occurs in transmission systems.

### Power Loss Calculation Principles

In this scenario, we start with 100 watts of transmitter output and experience a 6 dB loss in the transmission line. The calculation follows a straightforward logarithmic reduction:
- 3 dB loss = Power ÷ 2
- 6 dB loss = Power ÷ 4

So 100 watts reduced by 6 dB becomes 25 watts at the antenna output.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Typical Transmission Line Loss Scenarios:
- **RG-8U Coaxial Cable**: Can introduce 2-3 dB loss per 100 feet at HF frequencies
- **Hardline Antenna Feeders**: Might only introduce 0.5-1 dB loss over same distance
- **High-Frequency Bands**: More susceptible to transmission line loss due to higher frequency characteristics

### ❌ Common Misunderstandings About Power Loss:
- **Linear Thinking**: Assuming 1 dB always equals a fixed power reduction
- **Ignoring Cable Length**: Not accounting for total transmission line distance
- **Overlooking Frequency Dependence**: Assuming loss is constant across all frequencies

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Station Design:
1. **Cable Selection**: Choose low-loss transmission lines for critical links
2. **Power Budget Calculations**: Always factor in expected transmission line losses
3. **Antenna System Planning**: Consider how cable length affects effective radiated power

### For Different Frequency Bands:
1. **HF Operations**: Lower frequencies generally have less transmission line loss
2. **VHF/UHF**: More significant losses require more careful cable and connector selection
3. **Microwave Bands**: Extremely sensitive to transmission line performance

### Memory Aid:
"**D**B **D**rops **D**own" - Every 3 dB drops power by half, every 6 dB drops power by quarter.
