question: "The electrodes of a semiconductor diode are known as:"
answers:
  - text: "anode and cathode"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a semiconductor diode, the anode and cathode are the two primary electrodes that define the device's fundamental operation. The anode is the positive terminal where conventional current enters the diode, while the cathode is the negative terminal where current exits. These electrodes are critical in determining the diode's directional current flow, allowing current to pass easily in one direction (forward bias) and blocking it in the reverse direction."
  - text: "gate and source"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Gate and source are terms specifically used in field-effect transistors (FETs), not diodes. These terms describe the control and input electrodes of transistors, which operate differently from simple two-terminal diodes. Mixing up electrode terminology across different semiconductor components demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic electronic component structures."
  - text: "collector and base"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Collector and base are electrode terms used in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), which are three-terminal devices with fundamentally different operating principles compared to diodes. These terms describe the current-carrying and control electrodes of transistors, not the two-terminal structure of a diode."
  - text: "cathode and drain"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Drain is another term specific to field-effect transistors, not diodes. While the cathode is correctly identified, pairing it with 'drain' shows a misunderstanding of semiconductor device electrode terminology. Diodes have a simple two-electrode structure, unlike more complex transistor devices."

## The Concept: Diode Electrode Fundamentals

A semiconductor diode is a two-terminal electronic component that allows current to flow easily in one direction while blocking current in the opposite direction. This unique behavior is controlled by its two electrodes: the anode and the cathode.

The **anode** is the positive electrode where conventional current enters the diode, while the **cathode** is the negative electrode where current exits. Think of a diode like a one-way valve for electrical current - it lets electricity flow smoothly from anode to cathode under specific conditions, but prevents flow in the reverse direction.

### Semiconductor Physics Behind Diode Operation

At the atomic level, the anode-cathode structure creates a special region called the "p-n junction" where positively and negatively doped semiconductor materials meet. This junction enables the diode's remarkable ability to conduct electricity preferentially in one direction, making it a fundamental building block of modern electronic circuits.
