question: "What is the approximate length of the reflector element of a Yagi antenna for 28.1 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "5.34 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "The reflector element length is approximately 5.34 metres at 28.1 MHz, calculated using the fundamental antenna design principle of element length being related to wavelength. At this frequency, the wavelength is around 10.68 metres, and the reflector element is typically about 5% longer than a half-wavelength, which results in this specific length. This precise measurement allows the reflector to effectively redirect and concentrate radio wave energy in the desired direction."
  - text: "10.68 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length represents the full wavelength at 28.1 MHz, not the reflector element length. A full wavelength would be inappropriate for a single antenna element, as Yagi antennas use precise fractional wavelength calculations for each element to create directional gain."
  - text: "2.54 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is too short to be a functional reflector element at 28.1 MHz. A reflector element must be carefully sized to provide the correct phase relationship with the driven element to create directional gain."
  - text: "2.67 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is insufficiently short to serve as an effective reflector element at 28.1 MHz. Proper Yagi design requires precise element lengths based on wavelength calculations to achieve directional characteristics."

## The Concept: Wavelength and Antenna Geometry

Antenna design is fundamentally about understanding the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and physical element dimensions. For a Yagi antenna operating on the 10-meter band (28.1 MHz), each element's length is precisely calculated based on the wavelength at that frequency.

The wavelength at 28.1 MHz is approximately 10.68 metres (calculated by dividing the speed of light, 300,000,000 m/s, by the frequency). The reflector element, which sits behind the driven element, is typically designed to be slightly longer than a half-wavelength to create a phase shift that enhances forward gain.

### Antenna Element Sizing Principles

In a Yagi antenna, each element plays a specific role:
- **Driven Element**: The active element connected to the transmission line
- **Reflector**: Slightly longer than a half-wavelength, redirects radio waves forward
- **Director Elements**: Slightly shorter than a half-wavelength, further focuses the signal
