question: "What sound is heard from a public address system if audio rectification of a nearby CW transmission occurs?"
answers:
  - text: "On-and-off humming or clicking"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Audio rectification occurs when a non-linear electronic device (like an improperly shielded amplifier or speaker system) demodulates a nearby radio frequency signal, converting the on-off keying of a CW (Morse code) transmission into an audible sound. The result is an intermittent humming or clicking that matches the rhythm of the Morse code transmission being received nearby."
  - text: "Audible, possibly distorted speech"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would be characteristic of AM (Amplitude Modulation) signal rectification, not CW transmission. CW signals are on-off keyed carriers without audio modulation, so they would produce distinct clicking or humming, not speech-like sounds."
  - text: "Muffled, severely distorted speech"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Distorted speech suggests a different type of signal interference or audio problem. CW rectification produces distinct, rhythmic clicking or humming, not muffled speech sounds."
  - text: "A steady whistling"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A steady whistling is more typical of heterodyne interference or beat frequency oscillation, not the on-off nature of CW signal rectification. The CW rectification produces intermittent sounds that match the Morse code pattern."

## The Concept: Audio Rectification and Signal Detection

Audio rectification is a phenomenon where non-linear electronic devices accidentally convert radio frequency signals into audible sounds. In amateur radio, this most commonly occurs when a nearby CW (Continuous Wave) transmission interacts with audio equipment that isn't properly shielded or filtered.

A non-linear device acts like a primitive radio detector, converting the on-off keying of a Morse code transmission into an electrical signal that can be heard through speakers or audio systems. This is similar to how early radio receivers worked before the development of more sophisticated detection methods.

### The Physics of Unintended Detection

When a radio frequency signal passes through a non-linear electronic component (like a transistor, diode, or poorly designed amplifier), it can create electrical variations that correspond to the original signal's characteristics. In the case of CW transmission, this means the on-off keying of Morse code gets converted into an audible pattern of sounds.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Typical Audio Rectification Scenarios:
- **Public Address System**: Speakers picking up nearby amateur radio CW transmission
- **Computer Speakers**: Hearing clicking sounds when a radio transmitter is nearby
- **Guitar Amplifiers**: Unexpected audio artifacts from nearby radio signals

### ❌ Scenarios That Don't Produce CW Rectification:
- **Properly Shielded Audio Equipment**: Modern devices with good RF filtering
- **Digital Signal Processing Systems**: Advanced audio systems that reject RF interference
- **Fiber Optic Audio Systems**: No electrical pathway for signal conversion
