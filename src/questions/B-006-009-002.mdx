question: "How can the directivity of a half-wave dipole be increased?"
answers:
  - text: "By adding one or more parasitic elements"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Adding parasitic elements like reflectors or directors creates a Yagi-style antenna configuration that dramatically increases directivity. These passive, non-driven elements interact with the driven half-wave dipole to focus and concentrate the radiation pattern in a specific direction, creating gain and improved directional characteristics. This technique allows the antenna to concentrate its radiated energy more efficiently toward a desired direction."
  - text: "By using a radiating element with a larger diameter"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Changing the element diameter affects antenna bandwidth and impedance characteristics, but does not inherently improve directivity. While a larger diameter can slightly broaden the antenna's frequency response and reduce ohmic losses, it doesn't create the focused radiation pattern associated with increased directivity."
  - text: "By adding traps to the radiating element"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Traps are used for multi-band operation by creating additional resonant points in the antenna, but they do not increase directivity. Traps allow a single antenna to operate on multiple frequencies by electrically shortening the radiating element at specific frequencies, but they do not alter the fundamental radiation pattern or directional characteristics."
  - text: "By lengthening the radiating element"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Lengthening a half-wave dipole beyond its resonant length will change its resonant frequency and impedance, but will not increase directivity. In fact, significant length changes may cause the antenna to become less efficient and deviate from its optimal radiation pattern."

## The Concept: Antenna Directivity and Parasitic Elements

Directivity in antenna design refers to the ability to concentrate radio wave radiation in a specific direction, creating a more focused and efficient signal transmission. A basic half-wave dipole radiates equally in two opposite directions, forming a characteristic figure-eight pattern. By introducing **parasitic elements** - passive, undriven antenna elements - you can reshape this radiation pattern to achieve more concentrated energy in a desired direction.

Parasitic elements work through electromagnetic coupling and interaction. When placed near the driven (active) dipole element, these passive elements create constructive and destructive interference patterns that modify the overall radiation characteristics. The two most common parasitic element configurations are:

1. **Reflector Elements**: Placed behind the driven element, slightly longer than the driven dipole
2. **Director Elements**: Placed in front of the driven element, slightly shorter than the driven dipole

### The Physics of Parasitic Element Interaction

When a parasitic element is placed near a driven element, electromagnetic fields are induced in the passive element. These induced currents re-radiate and interact with the primary signal, effectively steering and concentrating the radiation pattern in a specific direction.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Effective Directivity Enhancement:
- **Yagi Antenna**: Classic design using multiple parasitic elements to create highly directional radiation
- **TV Rooftop Antennas**: Multiple elements focused on receiving signals from specific broadcast towers
- **Amateur Radio Beam Antennas**: Directional antennas used for long-distance communication

### ❌ Ineffective Directivity Approaches:
- **Simple Dipole**: Omnidirectional radiation pattern with no focused energy
- **Changing Element Diameter**: Minimal impact on directional characteristics
- **Random Element Placement**: Without precise spacing and length, parasitic elements become ineffective
