question: "In voice contacts, what is the meaning of \"Your signal report is 1 1\"?"
answers:
  - text: "Your signal is unreadable, and barely perceptible"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In the RST (Readability, Strength, Tone) signal reporting system, a report of '1 1' represents the lowest possible rating for both readability and signal strength. This means the received signal is extremely weak and almost impossible to understand, with only a hint of a signal barely detectable above the noise floor."
  - text: "Your signal is 11 dB over S9"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This interpretation misunderstands the RST system. The first number represents readability (1-5 scale), and the second represents signal strength (1-9 scale). A report of '1 1' indicates the lowest possible signal quality, not an elevated signal strength measurement above S9."
  - text: "Your signal is moderately readable with moderate strength"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A '1 1' report is actually the opposite of a moderate signal. It represents the absolute lowest level of signal readability and strength, where the signal is nearly non-existent and cannot be reliably understood."
  - text: "Your signal is very readable and very strong"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This interpretation is completely incorrect. A '1 1' report indicates the poorest possible signal conditions, with the signal being barely perceptible and almost completely unreadable."

# Understanding RST Signal Reporting: Decoding the '1 1' Signal Report

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The RST (Readability, Strength, Tone) signal reporting system
- How to interpret different levels of signal quality in amateur radio communications
- The significance of numerical signal reports
- The importance of precise communication in radio contacts

## The Concept: RST Signal Reporting System

The RST (Readability, Strength, Tone) system is a standardized method used by amateur radio operators to communicate the quality of a received radio signal. It provides a quick, objective way to describe signal characteristics during a contact. The system uses three numbers:

1. **Readability (R)**: How clearly the signal can be understood
   - 1: Unreadable
   - 2: Barely readable, occasional words distinguishable
   - 3: Readable with difficulty
   - 4: Readable with no difficulty
   - 5: Perfectly readable

2. **Strength (S)**: Signal power as perceived by the receiver
   - 1: Faint signals, barely perceptible
   - 3-4: Very weak signals
   - 5-6: Weak signals
   - 7-8: Good signals
   - 9: Very strong signals

3. **Tone (T)**: Signal audio quality (primarily for Morse code/CW)
   - Typically only used for continuous wave (CW) transmissions

### The Significance of '1 1'

A '1 1' report represents the absolute lowest possible signal quality. It means the signal is:
- **Unreadable**: You cannot understand any words or make out any coherent communication
- **Barely Perceptible**: The signal is just barely detectable above the noise level, almost like a ghost signal

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Scenarios Resulting in a '1 1' Signal Report:
- **Extreme Distance Contact**: Attempting to communicate from opposite sides of a continent with low-power equipment
- **Severe Atmospheric Interference**: During intense solar storms or electromagnetic disturbances
- **Obstructed Signal Path**: Signals blocked by massive terrain features or dense urban environments

### ❌ Situations NOT Resulting in a '1 1' Report:
- **Local Repeater Contacts**: Typically have much stronger, more readable signals
- **Nearby HF Contacts**: Usually maintain at least a 3-4 readability and strength
- **Mobile or Portable Operations**: Generally have more stable signal conditions

## Practical Applications

### For Communication Strategy:
1. **Recognize Poor Conditions**: A '1 1' report indicates you need to change communication approach
2. **Consider Alternative Modes**: Switch to more robust modes like digital communication
3. **Adjust Transmission Parameters**: Increase power, change antenna, or find a better signal path

### For Signal Improvement:
1. **Check Equipment**: Verify antenna connections and transmission system
2. **Evaluate Propagation**: Use propagation prediction tools to find better communication windows
3. **Explore Alternative Bands**: Different frequencies might offer better signal paths

### Memory Aid:
"**1-1 = Barely Alive**" - A signal report of '1 1' means the signal is just barely surviving, almost not there at all.

## Key Takeaways

- A '1 1' signal report represents the lowest possible signal quality in the RST system
- The first '1' indicates unreadable communication
- The second '1' indicates a signal that is barely perceptible
- This report suggests immediate need for signal path or transmission method adjustment
- Understanding RST helps operators diagnose and improve communication conditions
