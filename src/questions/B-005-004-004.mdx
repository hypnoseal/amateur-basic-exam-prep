question: "How is the voltage in a DC circuit calculated when the current and resistance are known?"
answers:
  - text: "Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This statement correctly describes Ohm's Law, which defines the fundamental relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. By multiplying the current flowing through a component by its resistance, you can calculate the voltage drop across that component. This fundamental equation (V = I × R) is critical for understanding electrical circuits in both theoretical and practical amateur radio applications."
  - text: "Voltage equals current divided by resistance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is an incorrect rearrangement of Ohm's Law. While this formula can be used to calculate resistance (R = V/I), it does not correctly represent how to calculate voltage when current and resistance are known. Inverting the relationship would lead to incorrect electrical calculations and potentially dangerous misunderstandings of circuit behavior."
  - text: "Voltage equals resistance divided by current"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is a mathematically nonsensical relationship that would not produce a valid voltage calculation. The units and physical principles of electrical circuits do not support this formula. Attempting to divide resistance by current would produce an incorrect and meaningless result in terms of electrical measurement."
  - text: "Voltage equals power divided by current"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While power, current, and voltage are related in electrical circuits (P = V × I), this specific formula does not correctly calculate voltage. Dividing power by current would not yield an accurate voltage measurement and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of electrical relationships."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Electrical Relationships

Ohm's Law is the foundational principle that describes how electrical components interact in a direct current (DC) circuit. Named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, this law establishes the mathematical relationship between three fundamental electrical properties: voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R).

The core equation, V = I × R, explains how voltage can be calculated when you know the current flowing through a component and its resistance. Think of this like water flowing through a pipe: the voltage is like the water pressure, current is the volume of water flowing, and resistance is like the pipe's narrowness that restricts that flow.

### Why This Matters in Amateur Radio

Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for amateur radio operators because it helps you:
- Design and troubleshoot circuits
- Calculate power requirements for equipment
- Understand how electrical components interact
- Prevent damage to sensitive radio electronics

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Voltage Calculations:
- **Battery Circuit**: A 2A current flowing through a 6Ω resistor produces 12V (2A × 6Ω = 12V)
- **LED Circuit**: A 20mA current through a 220Ω resistor results in 4.4V (0.02A × 220Ω = 4.4V)
- **Transceiver Power Supply**: Calculating voltage drop in power distribution circuits

### ❌ Incorrect Calculation Approaches:
- **Dividing Resistance by Current**: Produces meaningless results
- **Mixing Up Multiplication and Division**: Leads to incorrect voltage estimates
- **Ignoring Units**: Failing to track electrical units during calculations
