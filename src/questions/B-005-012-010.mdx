question: "Resonance is the condition that exists when:"
answers:
  - text: "inductive reactance and capacitive reactance are equal and opposite in sign"
    correct: true
    explanation: "At resonance, inductive reactance and capacitive reactance precisely cancel each other out, creating a unique electrical condition where the circuit's reactive components neutralize each other. This results in a circuit where only resistance remains, leading to maximum power transfer and minimum impedance."
  - text: "inductive reactance is the only opposition in the circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because resonance involves both inductive and capacitive reactances being equal and opposite, not just the presence of inductive reactance. A circuit with only inductive reactance would not be in a resonant state."
  - text: "the circuit contains no resistance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Resonance does not mean the absence of resistance. In fact, resistance plays a critical role in determining the sharpness of the resonance and the circuit's bandwidth. A circuit without resistance would behave differently from a real-world resonant circuit."
  - text: "resistance is equal to the reactance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this condition might seem similar to resonance, it is not the precise definition. At resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal and opposite, canceling each other out, which is different from resistance being equal to reactance."

## The Concept: Electrical Resonance Explained

**Resonance** is a fundamental electromagnetic phenomenon where the reactive components in an electrical circuit—specifically inductors and capacitors—create a unique state of balance. At this precise point, the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC) are exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, effectively canceling each other out.

Imagine two equal weights on opposite sides of a perfectly balanced scale—this is analogous to how reactances behave during resonance. The reactive energy oscillates between the inductor and capacitor without net energy loss, leaving only the circuit's resistance to determine current flow and power dissipation.

### The Mathematical Perspective

In a series RLC circuit, resonance occurs when:
- XL = XC
- Calculated as: XL = 2πfL and XC = 1/(2πfC)
- At the resonant frequency (fr), these reactances precisely cancel

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Resonance in Action:
- **Antenna Design**: Dipole and other resonant antennas maximize signal transfer
- **Filter Circuits**: Creating precise frequency selection in radio receivers
- **Oscillator Circuits**: Generating stable, consistent frequencies in transmitters

### ❌ Non-Resonant Circuit Behaviors:
- **Mismatched Reactances**: Unequal inductive and capacitive components
- **Purely Resistive Circuits**: No reactive energy storage or exchange
- **Circuits with Unbalanced Components**: Reduced efficiency and signal transfer
