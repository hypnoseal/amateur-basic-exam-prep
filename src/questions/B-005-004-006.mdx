question: "What value of resistance is required to drop 9 volts with a current of 10 milliamperes?"
answers:
  - text: "900 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), this calculation requires dividing the voltage (9V) by the current (0.010A). 9V ÷ 0.010A = 900 ohms. This represents the precise resistance needed to create the specified voltage drop with the given current flow, demonstrating the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits."
  - text: "90 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This resistance value is incorrect. If 90 ohms were used, the resulting current would be 0.1A (100 mA) at 9V, which does not match the specified 10 milliampere current requirement. The calculation 9V ÷ 0.1A = 90 ohms fails to meet the problem's specific parameters."
  - text: "9 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This resistance value would cause an excessive current flow. At 9V ÷ 9 ohms, the current would be 1A (1000 mA), which is far higher than the 10 milliamperes specified in the problem. This demonstrates how low resistance leads to higher current in electrical circuits."
  - text: "9000 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This resistance value would result in a much lower current than specified. Using Ohm's Law, 9V ÷ 9000 ohms would produce only 0.001A (1 mA), which is one-tenth of the required 10 milliamperes. This shows how high resistance restricts current flow in electrical circuits."

# Ohm's Law: Understanding Voltage, Current, and Resistance Relationships

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How to apply Ohm's Law in practical electrical calculations
- The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance
- How to calculate resistance when voltage and current are known
- The importance of precise electrical calculations in amateur radio

## The Concept: Ohm's Law Fundamentals

Ohm's Law is the foundational principle that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in electrical circuits. Represented by the formula V = I × R, this law allows you to calculate any of these three values when you know the other two.

In electrical systems, you can think of this relationship like water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is the water pressure, current is the volume of water flowing, and resistance is like the pipe's diameter - it determines how much water can flow under a given pressure. The wider the pipe (lower resistance), the more water flows (higher current) for a given pressure (voltage).

### Why This Matters in Amateur Radio

Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for amateur radio operators because it helps you:
- Design and troubleshoot circuits
- Calculate power requirements for equipment
- Understand how components interact in radio systems
- Prevent damage to sensitive electronic components

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Resistance Calculations:
- **Battery Circuit Design**: Determining the right resistor to limit current to an LED
- **Power Supply Protection**: Calculating series resistance to prevent overcurrent
- **Voltage Divider Circuits**: Creating precise voltage levels for measurement or control

### ❌ Incorrect Resistance Approaches:
- **Guessing Resistor Values**: Randomly selecting resistors without calculation
- **Ignoring Current Limits**: Using resistors that allow excessive current flow
- **Misunderstanding Unit Conversions**: Failing to convert between milliamps and amps

## Practical Applications

### For Circuit Design:
1. **Convert Units Correctly**: Always convert milliamperes to amperes (10 mA = 0.010 A)
2. **Use Ohm's Law Formula**: V = I × R, rearrange to R = V ÷ I
3. **Double-Check Calculations**: Verify your math to prevent component damage

### For Radio Equipment:
1. **Power Supply Sizing**: Calculate appropriate resistances for voltage regulation
2. **LED Indicator Circuits**: Limit current to prevent burning out components
3. **Voltage Divider Networks**: Create precise voltage levels for measurement

### Memory Aid:
"**V**ery **I**mportant **R**adio Rule: Voltage Equals Current times Resistance"
