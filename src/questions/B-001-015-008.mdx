question: "What is the frequency range of the 20-metre amateur radio band in Canada?"
answers:
  - text: "14.000 MHz to 14.350 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the precise amateur radio band allocation for 20-metres in Canada, as defined by ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada). This 350 kHz wide band is a primary allocation for amateur radio, offering an excellent combination of long-distance propagation characteristics and reliable communication capabilities. These frequencies are part of the High Frequency (HF) spectrum and are popular for both voice and digital communication modes."
  - text: "13.500 MHz to 14.000 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range falls partially outside the official 20-metre amateur radio band. While it includes the lower edge of the band at 14.000 MHz, the lower limit of 13.500 MHz is not part of the authorized amateur radio spectrum. Amateur radio operators must strictly adhere to the officially allocated frequency ranges to avoid interference and regulatory violations."
  - text: "15.000 MHz to 15.750 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range is entirely outside the 20-metre band. These frequencies are located in a different part of the HF spectrum and are not allocated for amateur radio use. Transmitting on these frequencies would constitute an unauthorized transmission and could result in regulatory penalties."
  - text: "16.350 MHz to 16.830 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This frequency range is also completely outside the 20-metre amateur radio band allocation. These frequencies are located in a different segment of the radio spectrum and are not authorized for amateur radio use. Transmitting on these frequencies would violate Canadian amateur radio regulations."

# The 20-Metre Amateur Radio Band: A Window to Global Communication

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The precise frequency allocation for the 20-metre amateur radio band
- Why 20 metres is a critically important amateur radio band
- How frequency allocations are determined and maintained
- The significance of adhering to authorized frequency ranges

## The Concept: Understanding Amateur Radio Band Allocations

Amateur radio bands are specific frequency ranges allocated internationally and nationally for amateur radio use. The 20-metre band, spanning from 14.000 MHz to 14.350 MHz, is one of the most popular HF (High Frequency) bands due to its exceptional propagation characteristics.

### Band Characteristics
The 20-metre band offers unique advantages for amateur radio operators:
- Excellent long-distance communication capabilities
- Reliable worldwide propagation during daylight hours
- Good performance for both voice and digital communication modes
- Relatively stable signal characteristics compared to other HF bands

### Regulatory Precision
Amateur radio frequency allocations are precisely defined to prevent interference with other radio services. The 14.000-14.350 MHz range is not arbitrary but carefully coordinated through international telecommunications agreements and implemented by national regulators like ISED in Canada.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper 20-Metre Band Usage:
- **Global Communication**: Contacting stations thousands of kilometers away
- **Digital Modes**: FT8, PSK31, and other narrow-bandwidth digital communications
- **International Amateur Radio Contests**: A primary band for worldwide contesting events

### ❌ Incorrect Band Usage:
- **Transmitting outside 14.000-14.350 MHz**: Potential regulatory violation
- **Interfering with adjacent spectrum users**: Risking international communication disruption
- **Using unauthorized power levels**: Potentially causing harmful interference

## Practical Applications

### For HF Communication:
1. **Daytime Propagation**: Excellent for intercontinental communication
2. **Portable Operations**: Compact antennas work effectively on this band
3. **Emergency Communications**: Reliable medium-distance communication capabilities

### For Different Operating Modes:
1. **SSB Voice**: Primary voice communication band
2. **CW (Morse Code)**: Lower portion of the band traditionally used
3. **Digital Modes**: Increasingly popular for efficient communication

### Memory Aid:
"**F**ourteen is **F**ine" - Remember 14.000-14.350 MHz as the 20-metre band range.
