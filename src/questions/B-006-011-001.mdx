question: "What design feature allows a single Yagi antenna to function on the 20-metre, 15-metre and 10-metre bands?"
answers:
  - text: "Element traps"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Traps are resonant circuits (typically parallel LC circuits) installed within Yagi antenna elements that electrically 'segment' the antenna, allowing different portions to be active on different frequency bands. By using carefully designed traps, different lengths of the antenna element become electrically active at different frequencies, enabling multiband operation from a single physical antenna structure."
  - text: "Large diameter elements"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While large diameter elements can improve antenna bandwidth and mechanical strength, they do not inherently enable multiband operation. Element diameter affects antenna impedance and efficiency, but does not provide the frequency-selective mechanism needed for multiband performance."
  - text: "Multiple reflector elements"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Multiple reflector elements would change the antenna's fundamental design and radiation pattern, but do not create the frequency-selective mechanism required for multiband operation. Reflector elements are fixed in their electrical relationship and do not provide the variable resonance needed to work across different bands."
  - text: "T-match feed circuit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A T-match feed circuit is an impedance matching technique that helps optimize power transfer between the transmission line and antenna, but it does not enable multiband operation. While important for antenna performance, the T-match does not provide the frequency-selective segmentation that traps offer."

## The Concept: Antenna Traps and Frequency Selectivity

A trap in an antenna is essentially an electrical "roadblock" that changes how current flows through an antenna element at different frequencies. Constructed as a parallel LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit, traps create sections of antenna that become electrically active or inactive depending on the operating frequency.

Imagine an antenna element like a flexible pipe where water (radio frequency current) can flow differently based on strategically placed valves. Traps act as those valves, dynamically changing the effective length of the antenna element across different frequency bands.

In a multiband Yagi, traps allow different segments of the antenna to resonate on 20m, 15m, and 10m bands without requiring three separate physical antennas. By carefully calculating the trap's resonant frequency, engineers can create an antenna that behaves optimally across multiple amateur radio bands.

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Space-Saving Solutions**: One antenna replacing multiple single-band antennas
2. **Reduced Installation Complexity**: Simpler mounting and fewer structural requirements
3. **Cost-Effective Multiband Performance**: Lower investment for broader operational flexibility

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Trap Design Precision**: Requires exact capacitance and inductance calculations
2. **Performance Trade-Offs**: Slight reduction in gain compared to single-band optimized antennas
3. **Environmental Durability**: Traps must withstand temperature and moisture variations
