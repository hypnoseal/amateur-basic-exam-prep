question: "What is the advantage of replacing a 50-ohm resistor with a parallel combination of two 100-ohm resistors of the same power rating?"
answers:
  - text: "Same resistance but greater power rating"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When two 100-ohm resistors are connected in parallel, their equivalent resistance is 50 ohms (1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2), matching the original resistor. However, because each resistor can now dissipate its rated power, the total power handling capability doubles. This means the parallel combination can handle twice the power of the original single resistor while maintaining the same overall resistance."
  - text: "Same resistance but lesser power rating"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Parallel resistors actually increase power handling capacity, not reduce it. Each resistor shares the total current, which means each can dissipate its full rated power, resulting in a higher total power handling capability."
  - text: "Greater resistance and same power rating"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. The parallel combination of two 100-ohm resistors results in a 50-ohm equivalent resistance, which is lower than the individual resistor values, not greater. The power rating is also increased, not maintained at the same level."
  - text: "Lesser resistance and same power rating"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the resistance does become lesser (50 ohms from two 100-ohm resistors), the power rating is not just maintained but actually increased due to the parallel configuration allowing each resistor to dissipate its full rated power."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance and Power Dissipation

In electrical circuits, connecting resistors in parallel creates a unique set of behaviors that can be strategically used to manage resistance and power handling. When resistors are placed in parallel, the total resistance decreases, while the ability to dissipate power increases.

The fundamental principle is that in a parallel configuration, each resistor receives the same voltage but can carry a portion of the total current. This means that the power dissipation is distributed across the resistors, effectively increasing the overall power handling capability of the circuit.

### Resistance Calculation in Parallel

When two resistors of equal value are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is calculated using the formula:

1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2

For two 100-ohm resistors, this results in a 50-ohm equivalent resistance, which matches the original single resistor's resistance.
