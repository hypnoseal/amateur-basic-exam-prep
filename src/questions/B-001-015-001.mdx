question: "If you let another amateur radio operator with additional qualifications than yours control your station and operate under your call sign, what operating privileges are allowed?"
answers:
  - text: "Only the privileges allowed by your qualifications"
    correct: true
    explanation: "As the station licensee, you remain legally responsible for all operations conducted under your call sign. This means that even if a more qualified operator is using your station, they must operate within the privileges of your license, not their own. This regulation ensures accountability and prevents operators from circumventing licensing requirements by temporarily using another station."
  - text: "Any privileges allowed by the additional qualifications"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This would be incorrect because the station license is tied to the original licensee's qualifications. The higher-qualified operator cannot simply override the base station's authorized privileges, even if they personally have more extensive operating rights."
  - text: "All the emission privileges of the additional qualifications, but only the frequency privileges of your qualifications"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is not correct. The operator must adhere to ALL of the original licensee's privileges, both in terms of frequencies and emissions modes. Partially applying different qualification levels is not permitted under Canadian amateur radio regulations."
  - text: "All the frequency privileges of the additional qualifications, but only the emission privileges of your qualifications"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is another incorrect approach. The operator must strictly follow the original licensee's total set of privileges, not mixing and matching privileges from different qualification levels."

## The Concept: License Privileges and Station Accountability

Amateur radio is a licensed service where each operator is personally responsible for their station's compliance with regulations. Your amateur radio license is not just a permission slip—it's a legal document that defines your specific operating privileges and creates a chain of accountability for all radio transmissions.

When you allow another operator to use your station, you remain the ultimate responsible party. This means that regardless of the other operator's personal qualifications, they must operate strictly within the privileges defined by your specific license class. Think of it like lending your car—the driver must follow the rules associated with your vehicle's registration, not their own driving credentials.

### The Principle of Licensee Responsibility

The fundamental principle here is that the station license holder bears legal and regulatory responsibility for all transmissions. If an unauthorized or improper transmission occurs, the station licensee can be held accountable by ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada), even if they were not personally making the transmission.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Scenario Examples:
- **Basic Qualified Operator**: A Basic Qualified operator lets an Advanced Qualified operator use their station, but the Advanced operator must still operate only within Basic Qualified privileges
- **Supervised Learning**: An experienced amateur helps a newer operator practice, ensuring they only use permitted frequencies and modes
- **Field Day Operation**: A club station allows multiple operators to use the station, but each must respect the base station's license class

### ❌ Inappropriate Scenarios:
- **Privilege Expansion**: Allowing an Advanced operator to transmit on frequencies or modes not permitted by the base station license
- **Unsupervised Operation**: Letting an unqualified or improperly licensed operator use the station
- **Intentional Circumvention**: Using another operator's higher qualifications to bypass one's own licensing limitations

## Practical Applications

### For Station Management:
1. **Clear Communication**: Always discuss and confirm operating limitations before allowing another operator to use your station
2. **Documentation**: Maintain a log of who uses your station and under what circumstances
3. **Supervision**: Be present or readily available when other operators are using your station

### For Operating Procedures:
1. **Verify Qualifications**: Know the exact license class of anyone using your station
2. **Restrict Transmissions**: Ensure the operator understands and respects your license class limitations
3. **Monitor Compliance**: Periodically check that only authorized operations are being conducted

### Memory Aid:
"**Y**our **L**icense, **Y**our **L**imits" - Your license defines the operating boundaries, regardless of who is at the microphone.
