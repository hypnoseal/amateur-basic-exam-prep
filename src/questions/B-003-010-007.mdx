question: "When receiving a modulated signal, what is the adverse consequence of too narrow a receiver bandwidth?"
answers:
  - text: "Loss of information"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When a receiver's bandwidth is too narrow, it physically clips or truncates the sidebands of the modulated signal, which contain critical audio or data information. This results in distortion, loss of audio fidelity, and potentially missing entire portions of the transmitted signal's content. The bandwidth must be wide enough to capture all the signal's meaningful sidebands."
  - text: "Loss of dynamic range"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Dynamic range refers to the ratio between the strongest and weakest signals a receiver can process. Bandwidth narrowing doesn't directly impact dynamic range, which is more related to the receiver's amplification and detection circuits. Dynamic range is about signal strength variation, not signal information content."
  - text: "Lower signal strength"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Receiver bandwidth doesn't directly affect signal strength. Signal strength is determined by factors like transmitter power, antenna efficiency, and propagation conditions. Narrowing bandwidth might actually slightly improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but it won't change the original signal's strength."
  - text: "Lower signal-to-noise ratio"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Counterintuitively, narrowing bandwidth can actually improve signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the total noise power received. While this might seem like an advantage, it comes at the cost of losing signal information, which is why too narrow a bandwidth results in information loss."

- The technical principles governing signal bandwidth

## The Concept: Signal Bandwidth and Information Preservation

In radio communications, a modulated signal is more complex than a simple sine wave. When you transmit audio or data, the original information is encoded by creating **sidebands** - additional frequency components that extend above and below the carrier frequency. These sidebands contain the actual transmitted information.

Think of a modulated signal like a musical chord: the carrier frequency is the fundamental note, while the sidebands are the harmonics that give the sound its richness and complexity. If you cut off those harmonics, the sound becomes thin, distorted, and loses its original character.

### Modulation and Bandwidth

Different types of modulation (AM, SSB, FM) create different sideband characteristics:
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**: Creates symmetric sidebands extending above and below the carrier
- **SSB (Single Sideband)**: Transmits only one set of sidebands
- **FM (Frequency Modulation)**: Creates multiple sidebands depending on modulation deviation

A receiver's bandwidth must be wide enough to capture all these meaningful sidebands without clipping or distortion.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Bandwidth Handling:
- **Voice Communication**: SSB voice typically requires 2.4 kHz bandwidth to preserve speech clarity
- **Digital Modes**: PSK31 needs approximately 100 Hz bandwidth to preserve data integrity
- **Broadcast Radio**: AM radio allocates 10 kHz to capture full audio spectrum

### ❌ Consequences of Too Narrow Bandwidth:
- **Muffled Audio**: Speech sounds like it's coming through a telephone
- **Missing Consonants**: Critical speech components are cut off
- **Data Transmission Errors**: Digital modes become unreadable
- **Musical Instruments**: Lose harmonic richness and timbre

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Mode-Specific Bandwidth**: Choose receiver bandwidth matching your communication mode
2. **Filter Selection**: Use variable bandwidth filters for optimal reception
3. **Digital Mode Considerations**: Precise bandwidth critical for error-free data transmission

### Bandwidth Selection Strategies:
1. **Voice Modes**: 2.4 - 3 kHz bandwidth
2. **CW (Morse Code)**: 500 Hz bandwidth
3. **Digital Modes**: 100 - 500 Hz depending on specific protocol
4. **Experimental Modes**: Vary bandwidth based on specific requirements
