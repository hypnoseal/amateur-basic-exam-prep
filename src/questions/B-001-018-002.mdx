question: "An unmodulated carrier may be transmitted only:"
answers:
  - text: "for brief tests on frequencies below 30 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is the correct procedure for transmitting an unmodulated carrier, which is limited to brief testing purposes on HF frequencies below 30 MHz. These short tests allow operators to check transmission system performance, antenna matching, and equipment functionality without carrying communication content. The limitation to brief tests prevents unnecessary spectrum occupation and potential interference with other radio services."
  - text: "if the final RF amplifier output is kept under 5 watts"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Power output is not the determining factor for transmitting an unmodulated carrier. The restrictions are based on frequency, duration, and purpose of the transmission, not the power level. Transmitting an unmodulated carrier at low power would still violate amateur radio regulations if not conducted as a brief test on HF frequencies."
  - text: "for CW communication"
    correct: false
    explanation: "CW (Continuous Wave) communication is a form of modulated transmission where the carrier is keyed on and off to create dots and dashes. It is not an unmodulated carrier, but a purposeful communication mode with information content. CW transmissions follow different regulatory guidelines than pure unmodulated carrier tests."
  - text: "for holding a frequency until a net begins"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Holding a frequency with an unmodulated carrier is not permitted under amateur radio regulations. Operators are expected to use appropriate communication methods to reserve or indicate readiness to participate in a net, such as brief voice announcements or scheduled check-ins."

## The Concept: Unmodulated Carriers and Spectrum Etiquette

An **unmodulated carrier** is a radio frequency signal that is transmitted without any information content—essentially a pure, continuous tone at a specific frequency. In amateur radio, these transmissions are tightly regulated because they occupy spectrum space without serving a communication purpose and can potentially cause interference.

The amateur radio community operates under a principle of **spectrum efficiency**, which means maximizing the utility of limited radio frequencies. Unmodulated carriers represent an inefficient use of spectrum, as they don't carry any meaningful information and can disrupt other communications.

### Technical Considerations

Unmodulated carriers differ from modulated signals like:
- CW (Continuous Wave) communication, which uses on-off keying to transmit Morse code
- Voice modes that vary the carrier's amplitude or frequency
- Digital modes that encode information through signal variations

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Acceptable Unmodulated Carrier Uses:
- **Brief Equipment Testing**: Checking antenna matching and transmission system performance
- **Signal Strength Measurements**: Very short duration carrier to calibrate test equipment
- **Frequency Alignment**: Quick verification of transmitter frequency stability on HF bands

### ❌ Inappropriate Unmodulated Carrier Transmissions:
- **Prolonged Carrier Holding**: Occupying a frequency without communication purpose
- **Accidental Carrier Transmission**: Leaving a transmitter keyed without purpose
- **Frequency "Reservation"**: Using an unmodulated signal to claim a frequency

## Practical Applications

### For Technical Troubleshooting:
1. **Antenna System Checks**: Use brief unmodulated carriers to measure SWR
2. **Transmitter Alignment**: Verify frequency accuracy with short test transmissions
3. **Equipment Validation**: Confirm proper amplifier and antenna system performance

### Regulatory Compliance:
1. **Limit Test Duration**: Keep unmodulated carrier tests extremely brief
2. **Frequency Restrictions**: Only use below 30 MHz
3. **Minimize Potential Interference**: Choose times and frequencies with minimal active communications

### Memory Aid:
"**B**rief **T**ests **B**elow 30" - Unmodulated carriers are allowed for Brief Tests Below 30 MHz.
