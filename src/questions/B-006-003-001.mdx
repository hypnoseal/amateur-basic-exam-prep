question: "A transmission line must be supported for several metres by attaching it to a metal fence. What type of transmission line will NOT be adversely affected by proximity to the fence?"
answers:
  - text: "Coaxial cable"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Coaxial cable is uniquely designed with a shielded construction that prevents external metal objects from interfering with signal transmission. The inner conductor is completely surrounded by a continuous metallic shield (usually braided copper or aluminum), which acts as both a ground and an electromagnetic barrier, making it immune to nearby metal structures that would disrupt other transmission line types."
  - text: "Twin-lead"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Twin-lead transmission line consists of two parallel conductors separated by an insulating spacer. When placed near a metal fence, the electromagnetic field around the twin-lead can be severely distorted, causing impedance changes, signal reflection, and significant signal loss. The open design makes it extremely sensitive to nearby conductive surfaces."
  - text: "Open-wire line"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Open-wire transmission lines have exposed conductors with minimal spacing, making them highly susceptible to electromagnetic interference from nearby metal objects. A metal fence would cause significant signal coupling, impedance variations, and potential signal degradation, rendering the transmission line unreliable for effective signal transmission."
  - text: "Window line"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Window line (a type of open-wire transmission line with plastic windows between conductors) is just as vulnerable to metal object proximity as standard open-wire line. The metal fence would cause significant electromagnetic interactions, leading to signal reflection, impedance changes, and potential signal loss."

## The Concept: Transmission Line Electromagnetic Behavior

Transmission lines are critical components in amateur radio, carrying radio frequency (RF) signals between transmitters, receivers, and antennas. However, not all transmission lines are created equal when it comes to handling electromagnetic interference from nearby conductive surfaces.

The key difference lies in how the transmission line manages its electromagnetic field. Some lines have open, exposed conductors that are highly susceptible to external influences, while others have sophisticated shielding that prevents environmental interactions. This sensitivity determines how well a transmission line can maintain signal integrity when placed near metal structures like fences, towers, or building frameworks.

### Electromagnetic Field Principles

Every transmission line creates an electromagnetic field around its conductors. The way this field is contained or managed determines how susceptible the line is to external interference. Open transmission lines have widely exposed conductors, allowing easy interaction with nearby metal objects, while shielded lines like coaxial cable create a contained field that resists external influences.
