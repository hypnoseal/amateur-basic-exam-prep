question: "How much current is drawn by a 12-volt, 30-watt light bulb?"
answers:
  - text: "2.5 amperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using the power formula P = VI (Power = Voltage × Current), we can calculate the current by rearranging the formula to I = P/V. With 30 watts and 12 volts, the calculation is 30W ÷ 12V = 2.5 amperes. This demonstrates how electrical components convert electrical energy into other forms like light and heat."
  - text: "18 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value would be far too high for a 30-watt device on a 12-volt system. Calculating 30W ÷ 12V yields 2.5 amperes, not 18. This incorrect answer likely results from a misunderstanding of the basic power calculation or a computational error."
  - text: "4.8 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value is incorrect. Using the power formula P = VI, 30W ÷ 12V actually equals 2.5 amperes, not 4.8. This answer might stem from a calculation mistake or misapplication of the voltage-current-power relationship."
  - text: "0.4 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value is too low for a 30-watt device on a 12-volt system. Using P = VI, 30W ÷ 12V actually equals 2.5 amperes, not 0.4. This incorrect answer suggests an improper understanding of how power, voltage, and current interrelate."

## The Concept: Power, Voltage, and Current Relationships

Electrical power is fundamentally about the relationship between three key measurements: **power (watts)**, **voltage (volts)**, and **current (amperes)**. These quantities are interconnected through a simple but powerful equation: **P = VI** (Power equals Voltage multiplied by Current).

In practical terms, this formula allows you to calculate any of these three values if you know the other two. For amateur radio operators, understanding these relationships is crucial for designing circuits, selecting components, and managing power consumption in portable and fixed stations.

### The Mathematical Foundation

The power formula can be rearranged to solve for different variables:
- **P = VI** (Power calculation)
- **I = P/V** (Current calculation)
- **V = P/I** (Voltage calculation)

These formulas work consistently across electrical systems, from small electronic components to large power installations.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Power Calculations:
- **30W Light Bulb on 12V**: 30W ÷ 12V = 2.5A (amperes)
- **60W Laptop Charger on 120V**: 60W ÷ 120V = 0.5A
- **100W HF Radio on 13.8V**: 100W ÷ 13.8V ≈ 7.25A

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Forgetting Unit Conversion**: Always ensure consistent units
- **Misapplying the Formula**: Know which variable you're solving for
- **Neglecting Decimal Precision**: Round carefully in practical applications
