question: "What formula calculates the resistance of a circuit when the voltage and current are known?"
answers:
  - text: "R = E / I"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This formula, known as Ohm's Law, calculates resistance by dividing voltage (E) by current (I). When you know the electrical pressure (voltage) and the flow of electrons (current) in a circuit, you can determine the resistance that is opposing electron movement. This fundamental equation is crucial for understanding electrical circuits and designing amateur radio equipment."
  - text: "R = I / E"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This inverted formula would incorrectly calculate resistance by dividing current by voltage, which is mathematically incorrect and would produce meaningless results. Ohm's Law requires voltage divided by current to determine resistance."
  - text: "R = E squared / I"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Squaring the voltage unnecessarily complicates the basic Ohm's Law calculation and would produce an incorrect resistance value. The standard Ohm's Law formula uses voltage divided by current in its simplest form."
  - text: "R = E x I"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Multiplying voltage and current would not calculate resistance, but instead would result in power calculation. This formula would give watts, not ohms, and does not follow the fundamental relationship for determining circuit resistance."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Circuit Resistance

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (E), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. This relationship is often represented by the triangle diagram showing three interconnected formulas: R = E / I, E = I × R, and I = E / R.

Resistance represents the opposition to electrical current flow in a circuit, measured in ohms (Ω). Think of it like a narrow pipe restricting water flow - the narrower the pipe, the more resistance exists. In electrical terms, resistance determines how much current will flow when a specific voltage is applied.

The formula R = E / I allows you to calculate resistance when you know the voltage across a component and the current flowing through it. This calculation is crucial in designing circuits, troubleshooting electrical systems, and understanding how components interact in amateur radio equipment.
