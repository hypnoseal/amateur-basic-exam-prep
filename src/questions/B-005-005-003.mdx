question: "Several resistors of various values are connected in parallel. How does the total resistance of the combination compare to the individual resistors?"
answers:
  - text: "It is less than the smallest resistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is always lower than the smallest individual resistor. This occurs because parallel connections provide multiple paths for current flow, effectively reducing the overall resistance of the circuit. Each additional parallel resistor creates another route for electrons, making it easier for current to pass through the combined circuit."
  - text: "It is greater than the largest resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Parallel resistors always result in a total resistance that is lower than the smallest individual resistor, not higher than the largest one. Adding resistors in parallel actually reduces the overall circuit resistance by providing multiple current paths."
  - text: "It equals the average of the resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Simply taking the average of resistors does not correctly calculate parallel resistance. The actual calculation involves the reciprocal of the resistors, which means the total resistance will be lower than the average, not equal to it."
  - text: "It equals the square root of the sum of the resistors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This method does not accurately calculate parallel resistance. The correct method for calculating parallel resistance involves using the reciprocal of the resistors and then taking the reciprocal of that sum, which yields a result lower than any individual resistor."

## The Concept: Parallel Resistance Fundamentals

Parallel circuits provide multiple pathways for electrical current to flow. When resistors are connected in parallel, each resistor offers an alternative route for electrons, effectively reducing the total resistance of the circuit. This is analogous to adding multiple lanes to a highway - more lanes mean easier traffic flow, just as more parallel resistors mean easier current flow.

The mathematical principle governing parallel resistance is based on the reciprocal relationship. Instead of simply adding resistances, you add the reciprocals of the resistances and then take the reciprocal of that sum. This means that each additional resistor in parallel further reduces the total circuit resistance.

### The Parallel Resistance Formula

For two or more resistors in parallel, the total resistance (R_total) is calculated using:
1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...

This formula ensures that the total resistance is always lower than the smallest individual resistor in the parallel network.

### ❌ Incorrect Parallel Resistance Assumptions:
- **Averaging Resistances**: Simply taking the mean of resistor values does not work
- **Adding Resistances Directly**: This method completely misunderstands parallel circuit behavior
- **Assuming Larger Resistors Dominate**: In parallel, even small resistors significantly impact total resistance
