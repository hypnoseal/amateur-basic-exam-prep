question: "What is the resistance of a circuit if it draws 300 milliamperes from a 3-volt battery?"
answers:
  - text: "10 ohms"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), we can calculate the circuit's resistance by dividing the voltage (3 volts) by the current (0.300 amperes). 3V ÷ 0.300A = 10 ohms. This calculation demonstrates how voltage, current, and resistance are mathematically related in electrical circuits."
  - text: "9 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), 3V ÷ 0.300A = 10 ohms, not 9 ohms. The calculation requires precise division of voltage by current, which results in exactly 10 ohms in this scenario."
  - text: "5 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect. The calculation using Ohm's Law (V = I × R) shows that 3V ÷ 0.300A = 10 ohms, not 5 ohms. The resistance is determined by dividing the voltage by the current precisely."
  - text: "3 ohms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), 3V ÷ 0.300A = 10 ohms, not 3 ohms. The resistance is calculated by dividing the voltage by the current, which in this case yields 10 ohms."

## The Concept: Ohm's Law and Circuit Calculations

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The fundamental equation V = I × R allows you to calculate any of these three values if you know the other two.

In this specific problem, we're given a voltage of 3 volts and a current of 300 milliamperes (0.300 amperes). By rearranging Ohm's Law to solve for resistance (R = V ÷ I), we can precisely determine the circuit's resistance.

### Unit Conversion and Precision

Notice the importance of unit conversion: 300 milliamperes must be converted to 0.300 amperes for the calculation. This is a critical skill in electrical calculations, ensuring accurate results by maintaining consistent units.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Resistance Calculations:
- **3V ÷ 0.300A = 10 ohms**: Precise calculation using Ohm's Law
- **12V ÷ 1.2A = 10 ohms**: Another example showing the relationship between voltage and current
- **1.5V ÷ 0.150A = 10 ohms**: Demonstrating the consistent mathematical relationship

### ❌ Common Calculation Mistakes:
- **Forgetting unit conversion**: Using 300 milliamperes without converting to 0.300 amperes
- **Misapplying the formula**: Multiplying instead of dividing
- **Rounding too early in calculations**: Losing precision by premature rounding
