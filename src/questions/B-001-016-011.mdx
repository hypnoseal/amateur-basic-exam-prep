question: "Based on the frequency stated and emission mode, which of the following combinations is prohibited?"
answers:
  - text: "Single sideband (SSB) on 10.12 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Single sideband operation on 10.12 MHz is prohibited because this specific frequency falls within a CW-only segment of the 30-meter amateur band. The 10.100-10.140 MHz range is reserved exclusively for Morse code (CW) communications, and using SSB in this segment violates Canadian amateur radio band plan regulations."
  - text: "Frequency modulation (FM) on 29.6 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FM is permitted on 29.6 MHz, which is within the 10-meter band's frequency range where multiple modes are allowed, including FM, SSB, and CW. This is a standard operating frequency for 10-meter amateur radio communications."
  - text: "Morse radiotelegraphy (CW) on 10.11 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "CW operation on 10.11 MHz is permitted within the CW segment of the 30-meter band. This frequency is part of the designated CW-only portion of the band and follows standard amateur radio band plan regulations."
  - text: "FT8 on 10.136 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FT8, a digital mode, is permitted on 10.136 MHz. This frequency is within the digital mode segment of the 30-meter band, where various digital modes including FT8 are allowed under current amateur radio regulations."

- The specific regulations governing different amateur radio bands
- How to navigate band plans effectively

## The Concept: Amateur Radio Band Segmentation

Amateur radio bands are not uniform spaces where any mode can be used anywhere. Instead, they are carefully planned and segmented to accommodate different communication modes while minimizing interference. Each band has specific frequency ranges designated for particular modes of transmission, such as CW (Continuous Wave/Morse Code), SSB (Single Sideband), FM (Frequency Modulation), and digital modes.

The 30-meter band (10 MHz) is a particularly interesting example of strict mode segmentation. Unlike some other bands with more flexible mode allocations, the 30-meter band has very specific rules about where different modes can operate. This precision helps maintain efficient and interference-free communications among amateur radio operators worldwide.

### Why Mode-Specific Segmentation Matters

Mode-specific segmentation serves several critical purposes:
- Prevents interference between different types of communications
- Ensures efficient use of limited spectrum resources
- Allows different communication styles to coexist harmoniously
- Provides predictability for operators using specific modes

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Compliant Band Usage:
- **CW on 10.11 MHz**: Perfectly acceptable within the CW segment
- **FT8 on 10.136 MHz**: Permitted in the digital mode segment
- **FM on 29.6 MHz**: Allowed within the 10-meter band's flexible segment

### ❌ Non-Compliant Band Usage:
- **SSB on 10.12 MHz**: Prohibited in the CW-only segment
- **AM on the 20-meter phone sub-band**: Not permitted
- **Digital modes outside designated digital segments**: Potentially causing interference

## Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators:
1. **Always Consult Current Band Plans**: Regulations can change, so keep updated
2. **Use Mode-Specific Frequency Guides**: Many organizations publish detailed band plan charts
3. **Listen Before Transmitting**: Confirm current usage of the specific frequency segment

### For Different Operating Scenarios:
1. **Contesting**: Strict adherence to band plan segments is crucial
2. **DX Communications**: International band plans may have slight variations
3. **Emergency Communications**: Knowing exact permitted frequencies can be critical

### Memory Aid:
"**R**ight **M**ode, **R**ight **S**pot" - Always match your transmission mode to the correct frequency segment.
