question: "What is a \"QSL card\"?"
answers:
  - text: "A written proof of communication between two amateur radio operators"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A QSL card is a written confirmation of a radio contact (QSO) that serves as an official record of communication between amateur radio operators. These cards typically include critical details like date, time, frequency, signal report, and both operators' call signs. They are a long-standing tradition in amateur radio that helps operators document their communication achievements and can be used to verify contacts for awards and personal record-keeping."
  - text: "A notice of an apparent infraction from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. QSL cards are a voluntary communication tradition among amateur radio operators, not an official regulatory notice. ISED would use formal written communication for any regulatory infractions, not a QSL card format. Confusing an amateur radio communication tradition with a regulatory document misunderstands the purpose and nature of QSL cards."
  - text: "A postcard reminding you when your certificate will expire"
    correct: false
    explanation: "QSL cards are not administrative reminders about license expiration. While licenses do require renewal, this would be handled through official communication from ISED, not through the amateur radio operator-to-operator QSL card exchange system. This answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of both QSL cards and amateur radio licensing procedures."
  - text: "A letter or postcard from an amateur radio operator"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While a QSL card is indeed a postcard or card sent between amateur radio operators, this definition is too broad and lacks the specific purpose of documenting a radio contact. Not every postcard between amateurs is a QSL card - it must specifically confirm a previous radio communication (QSO) with precise technical details."

## The Concept: QSL Cards in Amateur Radio

A QSL card is a written confirmation of a radio contact (QSO) that serves as an official record of communication between amateur radio operators. The term "QSL" comes from the Q-code used in radio communication, specifically meaning "I confirm receipt of your transmission."

These cards are more than just simple postcards—they are historical documents that capture a moment of global communication. Typically, a QSL card includes critical details such as:
- Date and time of contact
- Frequency band
- Mode of transmission (SSB, CW, digital)
- Signal strength and readability reports
- Both operators' call signs
- Location of each operator

### The Cultural Significance of QSL Cards

Before the internet, QSL cards were the primary way amateur radio operators could prove and document their long-distance communications. Operators would collect these cards as proof of contacts, often displaying them as a badge of honor showing their global reach and communication skills.
