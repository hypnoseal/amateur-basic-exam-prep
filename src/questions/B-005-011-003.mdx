question: "A transformer with a single 12-volt secondary draws 0.5 amperes through its 120-volt primary. Assuming no losses, what current is drawn from the secondary?"
answers:
  - text: "5 amperes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In an ideal transformer, power input equals power output. The primary side draws 0.5A at 120V, which means the input power is 120V × 0.5A = 60 watts. On the secondary side, at 12V, this same 60 watts will require a current of 60W ÷ 12V = 5A. This demonstrates the fundamental principle of transformer power conservation: when voltage is stepped down, current proportionally increases to maintain the same total power."
  - text: "2.5 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This answer incorrectly calculates the secondary current by halving the primary current. In an ideal transformer, power remains constant, so the current changes inversely proportional to the voltage transformation ratio. The actual secondary current will be higher, not lower, to maintain the same total power."
  - text: "25 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is significantly higher than the correct secondary current. While transformers do increase current when stepping down voltage, this value would represent an unrealistic and incorrect power transformation."
  - text: "50 amperes"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This current value is far too high and does not reflect the actual power transformation in the transformer. The secondary current is determined by the voltage ratio and the need to maintain constant power across the transformer."

# Transformer Power Principles: Understanding Voltage, Current, and Power Conservation

## Learning Objectives

- The fundamental principles of ideal transformer operation

## The Concept: Transformer Power Transformation

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two circuits through electromagnetic induction. The key principle governing transformer operation is **power conservation**: the power input to the primary winding must equal the power output from the secondary winding, assuming an ideal (lossless) transformer.

### Power Conservation Equation
Power = Voltage × Current

In this transformer example:
- Primary Side: 120V × 0.5A = 60 watts
- Secondary Side: 12V × Secondary Current = 60 watts

By rearranging the equation, we can solve for the secondary current: 
Secondary Current = 60W ÷ 12V = 5A

This demonstrates how transformers can change voltage and current while maintaining constant power. When voltage is stepped down, current proportionally increases to maintain the same total power transfer.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Ideal Transformer Scenarios:
- **Step-Down Transformer**: Reduces voltage while increasing current
- **Power Supply Conversion**: Converting 120V AC to lower voltage for electronic devices
- **Audio Impedance Matching**: Transformers in sound systems that balance power transfer between components

### ❌ Incorrect Transformer Assumptions:
- **Ignoring Power Conservation**: Believing you can get more power out than you put in
- **Overlooking Current Changes**: Assuming current remains constant during voltage transformation
- **Neglecting Real-World Losses**: Treating all transformers as perfectly efficient

## Practical Applications

### For Electronics and Amateur Radio:
1. **Power Supply Design**: Understanding transformer principles when building power supplies
2. **Impedance Matching**: Using transformers to match different circuit impedances
3. **Signal Isolation**: Transformers can transfer power while electrically isolating input and output circuits

### For Calculation and Problem-Solving:
1. **Always check power conservation**: Input power should equal output power
2. **Use the voltage ratio to determine current changes**
3. **Remember that ideal transformers have no energy losses**

### Memory Aid:
"**V**oltage **D**owns, **C**urrent **U**ps" - When voltage goes down, current goes up to maintain constant power.
