question: "If you wire two 20-microfarad capacitors in series, what is the capacity of the combination?"
answers:
  - text: "10 microfarads"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When capacitors are connected in series, their total capacitance is less than the smallest individual capacitor value. The formula for series capacitance is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals, which for two equal capacitors results in half the original capacitance. With two 20 µF capacitors, the total capacitance becomes 10 µF."
  - text: "40 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. Series capacitor connection reduces total capacitance, not increases it. Adding capacitors in series decreases the overall capacitance, following the reciprocal relationship of series circuit components."
  - text: "80 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This value is completely incorrect. Series capacitor connection always reduces capacitance; it would never result in an increased total capacitance greater than the individual capacitor values."
  - text: "5 microfarads"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this calculation is close to the correct principle of series capacitance reduction, it does not accurately reflect the mathematical relationship for two equal capacitors."

## The Concept: Series Capacitor Calculations

Capacitors connected in series behave differently from those in parallel. Unlike parallel connections where capacitances add directly, series connections reduce the total capacitance through a reciprocal mathematical relationship.

The fundamental formula for series capacitance is:

1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + ...

For two equal capacitors, this simplifies to a straightforward calculation where the total capacitance is half the value of a single capacitor. This occurs because series connections increase the effective electrical distance between the plates, reducing the capacitor's ability to store charge.

### Electrical Analogy

Think of capacitors in series like water pipes in a long, connected system. Each additional pipe (capacitor) increases the total resistance to flow (reduces capacitance), making it harder for electrical charge to move through the circuit.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct Series Capacitor Calculations:
- **Two 20 µF Capacitors**: Total capacitance becomes 10 µF
- **Three 10 µF Capacitors**: Total capacitance reduces to 3.33 µF
- **Equal Value Capacitors**: Always reduce to half the smallest capacitor's value

### ❌ Incorrect Series Capacitor Assumptions:
- **Assuming Addition**: Believing capacitors in series will increase total capacitance
- **Ignoring Reciprocal Relationship**: Thinking all capacitors contribute equally
- **Neglecting Individual Capacitor Values**: Not recognizing how different capacitor values affect the total
