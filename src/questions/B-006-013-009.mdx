question: "What is the approximate length of the wire for a horizontal loop tuned at 7.15 MHz?"
answers:
  - text: "42.80 metres"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This length represents the full wavelength circumference for a horizontal loop antenna at 7.15 MHz. The calculation uses the fundamental formula of wavelength (λ) = 300 / frequency, multiplied by the loop's full perimeter requirement. This antenna design provides excellent omnidirectional radiation characteristics and good performance on the 40-meter amateur radio band."
  - text: "41.96 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While close to the correct length, this measurement doesn't precisely match the full wavelength calculation for a 7.15 MHz loop antenna. Small variations in loop length can significantly impact antenna resonance and performance, making precise measurement critical for optimal radio communication."
  - text: "10.49 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is too short to create a full wavelength loop at 7.15 MHz. A loop antenna requires a full wavelength circumference to achieve proper resonance and radiation efficiency, which for this frequency necessitates a much longer wire length."
  - text: "20.00 metres"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This length is insufficient for creating a full wavelength loop at 7.15 MHz. A proper horizontal loop antenna requires a wire length that encompasses a complete wavelength, which is significantly longer than 20 metres for this frequency."

## The Concept: Loop Antenna Fundamentals

A horizontal loop antenna is a full-wavelength wire antenna that forms a complete closed circuit, typically rectangular or square in shape. Unlike dipole antennas, loop antennas create a continuous conductive path that allows for unique radiation characteristics and excellent performance across multiple frequency bands.

The fundamental principle of loop antenna design is resonance, which occurs when the antenna's total wire length matches a full wavelength of the target frequency. For amateur radio operators, this means carefully calculating the precise wire length to achieve optimal signal transmission and reception.

### The Wavelength Calculation

The basic formula for calculating wavelength is:
**Wavelength (λ) = 300 / Frequency (MHz)**

For a full-wavelength loop, you multiply this wavelength by 4 to determine the total wire circumference. At 7.15 MHz, this results in a wire length of approximately 42.80 metres, which provides a resonant, efficient antenna for the 40-meter amateur radio band.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Effective Loop Antenna Configurations:
- **Full Wavelength Horizontal Loop**: Provides omnidirectional radiation pattern
- **Square Loop Design**: Easy to construct with consistent performance
- **Multiband Loop**: Can operate effectively on multiple harmonically related frequencies

### ❌ Ineffective Loop Antenna Approaches:
- **Undersized Loops**: Significantly reduced radiation efficiency
- **Irregular Shape Loops**: Introduces pattern distortions
- **Poorly Matched Feedpoint**: Leads to high SWR and reduced performance

## Practical Applications

### For Antenna Construction:
1. **Precise Measurement**: Use a calibrated measuring tape for accurate wire length
2. **Material Selection**: Use stranded, insulated copper wire for durability
3. **Support Considerations**: Ensure strong, non-conductive supports at loop corners

### For Multiband Operations:
1. **Harmonic Performance**: A 7.15 MHz loop will have harmonics at 14.3 MHz, 21.45 MHz, and 28.6 MHz
2. **Feedpoint Impedance**: Consider using a balanced antenna tuner for optimal matching
3. **Height Considerations**: Elevate the loop at least 1/2 wavelength above ground for best performance

### Memory Aid:
"**7 Goes Around 42**" - 7.15 MHz needs about 42.80 metres of wire for a full loop!
