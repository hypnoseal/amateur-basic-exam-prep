question: "What does a multimeter measure?"
answers:
  - text: "Voltage, current and resistance"
    correct: true
    explanation: "A multimeter is a fundamental electrical measurement tool that can directly measure three key electrical properties: voltage (potential difference), current (electron flow), and resistance (opposition to electron flow). These measurements are core to understanding electrical and electronic circuits, making the multimeter an essential instrument for amateur radio operators, electronics hobbyists, and technicians."
  - text: "Resistance, capacitance and inductance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While resistance can be measured by a standard multimeter, capacitance and inductance typically require specialized meters or dedicated measurement instruments like LCR meters. A standard multimeter does not have built-in capacitance or inductance measurement capabilities."
  - text: "Resistance and reactance"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A standard multimeter measures resistance, but does not directly measure reactance. Reactance is a more complex property related to alternating current (AC) circuits and requires specialized instruments like impedance bridges or vector network analyzers."
  - text: "SWR and power"
    correct: false
    explanation: "SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) and power measurements require specialized radio-specific instruments like SWR meters or power meters. A standard multimeter cannot perform these specific amateur radio measurements."

## The Concept: Electrical Measurement Fundamentals

A multimeter is essentially a Swiss Army knife of electrical measurement, providing insights into the fundamental characteristics of electrical circuits. The three core measurements—voltage, current, and resistance—form the foundation of understanding how electricity behaves in electronic systems.

**Voltage** represents the electrical potential difference between two points, measured in volts (V). It's like the electrical "pressure" that drives electrons through a circuit. **Current** measures the flow of electrons, quantified in amperes (A), while **resistance** indicates how much a material opposes that electron flow, measured in ohms (Ω).

### The Electrical Measurement Triad

Think of these measurements like a water system: 
- Voltage is like water pressure
- Current is like water flow rate
- Resistance is like the pipe's diameter and material that affects that flow

These measurements are critical in amateur radio for understanding everything from power supply performance to antenna system characteristics and circuit design.
