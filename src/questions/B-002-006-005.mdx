question: "What is the meaning of: \"You are 5 9 plus 20 dB\"?"
answers:
  - text: "You are perfectly readable with a signal strength 20 decibels greater than S9"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This is a precise signal report using the RS(T) system with an additional decibel strength indication. '5 9' represents perfect readability (5) and perfect signal strength (9), and the '+20 dB' further quantifies that the signal is 20 decibels stronger than the standard S9 reference level, indicating an exceptionally strong signal well above normal received signal strengths."
  - text: "The bandwidth of your signal is 20 decibels above linearity"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This interpretation misunderstands signal reporting protocols. The decibel reference is about signal strength, not signal bandwidth. Bandwidth measurements relate to the width of the transmitted signal, which is not part of this type of signal report. The '+20 dB' specifically refers to signal power, not signal characteristics like bandwidth."
  - text: "Repeat your transmission on a frequency 20 kHz higher"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is completely unrelated to the signal report. The phrase is a standard communication method for describing signal strength using the RS(T) system, not an instruction about frequency shifting. Such an interpretation would violate standard amateur radio communication protocols and signal reporting conventions."
  - text: "Your signal strength has increased by a factor of 100"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While decibels do represent logarithmic increases, '+20 dB' does not directly mean a 100-fold increase. Each 10 dB represents a 10-fold power increase, so +20 dB actually represents a 100-fold power increase, but this is not the standard way to describe such an increase in amateur radio signal reports."

## The Concept: Signal Reporting in Amateur Radio

The RS(T) system is a standardized method for reporting signal quality in amateur radio communications. **R** stands for Readability, **S** for Signal Strength, and **T** for Tone (primarily used for Morse code transmissions). This system provides a quick, objective way for operators to communicate the quality of a received signal.

In the standard RS(T) system, readability and signal strength are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (readability) and 1 to 9 (signal strength). A report of "5 9" represents perfect readability and maximum standard signal strength. The addition of decibel measurements allows for more precise strength reporting beyond the standard S-meter scale.

### Decibel Measurement in Signal Reporting

A decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values, often used in radio to describe power levels. In signal reporting, '+20 dB' means the signal is 20 decibels stronger than the standard S9 reference point. Each 10 dB increase represents a ten-fold increase in signal power.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Proper Signal Report Interpretations:
- **"5 9 +20 dB"**: Perfectly readable signal, significantly stronger than normal
- **"5 9 +10 dB"**: Excellent readability with very strong signal
- **"5 9 +30 dB"**: Extremely powerful signal, potentially local or very close station

### ❌ Incorrect Signal Report Interpretations:
- **Misunderstanding dB as frequency**: Thinking '+20 dB' means a frequency adjustment
- **Confusing dB with absolute power**: Believing dB directly represents watts
- **Ignoring the logarithmic nature**: Treating decibels as linear measurements
