question: "The total resistance of resistors connected in series is:"
answers:
  - text: "greater than the resistance of any one resistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "When resistors are connected in series, their individual resistance values are added together. This means the total resistance increases as more resistors are added to the circuit, always resulting in a total resistance greater than any single resistor's resistance. This follows directly from the basic principles of electrical circuit theory."
  - text: "less than the resistance of any one resistor"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect. In a series circuit, adding resistors increases the total resistance, not decreases it. Each additional resistor creates more opposition to current flow, raising the overall circuit resistance."
  - text: "equal to the highest resistance present"
    correct: false
    explanation: "In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of all individual resistances, not just the highest resistance value. Each resistor contributes its full resistance to the total circuit resistance."
  - text: "equal to the lowest resistance present"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Series circuits do not reduce to the lowest resistance. Instead, the total resistance is calculated by adding all individual resistor values together, which will always be greater than the lowest individual resistance."

## The Concept: Series Resistance Fundamentals

In electrical circuits, when resistors are connected end-to-end in a single path, they are said to be in "series". In this configuration, the same electric current flows through each resistor, and the total resistance is calculated by simply adding the individual resistance values together.

Mathematically, this is expressed as: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn

Imagine water flowing through a series of narrow pipes - each pipe introduces additional resistance to the water's flow. Similarly, each resistor in a series circuit increases the total electrical resistance, making it harder for current to flow through the entire circuit.

### Why Resistance Increases in Series

The fundamental principle behind series resistance is that electrical current must pass through each resistor sequentially. Each resistor represents an additional "obstacle" to electron flow, incrementally increasing the total circuit resistance. This is why adding more resistors in series always results in a higher total resistance.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Series Resistance Scenarios:
- **Christmas Light Strings**: Traditional holiday light strings are wired in series, where a single burned-out bulb increases total circuit resistance
- **Battery-Powered Devices**: Multiple batteries connected in series increase the total voltage while also changing circuit resistance
- **Electronic Component Design**: Many electronic circuits use series resistance for current limiting and voltage division

### ❌ Misconceptions About Series Resistance:
- **Thinking Resistance Decreases**: Adding resistors always increases total resistance
- **Assuming Highest Resistance Dominates**: All resistors contribute to the total, not just the largest value
- **Confusing Series with Parallel Circuits**: Parallel circuits behave very differently from series circuits
