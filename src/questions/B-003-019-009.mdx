question: "What is a safe method to discharge power supply filter capacitors?"
answers:
  - text: "Use an insulated shorting stick with an inline resistor"
    correct: true
    explanation: "This method provides the safest approach to discharging high-voltage capacitors by controlling the discharge rate and preventing potential arc flash or sudden energy release. The inline resistor limits the current flow, preventing potential damage to the capacitor or creating a dangerous electrical spike. The insulated stick ensures personal safety by preventing direct contact with high-voltage components."
  - text: "Use a long screwdriver with an insulated handle"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Using a screwdriver is extremely dangerous and can lead to catastrophic injury. An uncontrolled discharge can create a massive arc, potentially welding the screwdriver to the capacitor terminals, causing burns, or creating explosive metal spray. The metal shaft could conduct full discharge current, bypassing the insulated handle and creating a serious shock hazard."
  - text: "Use an insulated wire with alligator clips on each end"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While the wire is insulated, this method lacks the crucial current-limiting resistor. A direct short with alligator clips can create an uncontrolled, high-current discharge that can damage equipment, cause arcing, and potentially create a dangerous electrical explosion. The sudden current surge can destroy the capacitor and create significant personal safety risks."
  - text: "Allow time for bleeder resistors to discharge the capacitors"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While bleeder resistors help gradually discharge capacitors during normal operation, they cannot be relied upon as a primary discharge method, especially after equipment has been powered off. Bleeder resistors have limited current capacity and may take an extended time to fully discharge large capacitance or high-voltage power supply capacitors, leaving residual dangerous voltage."

## The Concept: Capacitor Energy Storage and Discharge Dynamics

Capacitors are energy storage devices that can hold electrical charge even after power is disconnected. In amateur radio power supplies, large electrolytic filter capacitors can store significant energy at potentially lethal voltages—sometimes hundreds of volts—even minutes after the power is turned off.

The fundamental challenge in capacitor discharge is managing the rapid release of stored electrical energy. A capacitor doesn't discharge linearly like a battery; it releases energy in a sudden, potentially explosive manner if not properly controlled. The total energy stored is calculated by the formula E = ½CV², where C is capacitance and V is voltage.

### Why Controlled Discharge Matters

Uncontrolled capacitor discharge can result in:
- Electrical arcing
- Potential equipment damage
- Severe personal injury or electrocution
- Component destruction through massive current spikes

## Practical Applications

### For Power Supply Maintenance:
1. **Always Disconnect Power First**: Ensure equipment is completely unplugged before discharge
2. **Use Proper Safety Equipment**: Insulated gloves, safety glasses
3. **Discharge Methodically**: Connect discharge tool systematically, avoiding rapid movements

### For Different Equipment Types:
1. **High-Power Amplifiers**: Require extremely careful discharge procedures
2. **Vintage Electronics**: Often have larger, more dangerous capacitors
3. **Portable Equipment**: Still require careful discharge even with lower voltages

### Memory Aid:
"**S**low and **S**afe **S**horts Save Souls" - Always use a controlled discharge method with resistance.
