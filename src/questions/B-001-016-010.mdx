question: "Based on the frequency stated and emission mode, which of the following combinations is prohibited?"
answers:
  - text: "Fast-scan television (ATV) on 14.23 MHz"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Amateur radio regulations prohibit fast-scan television (ATV) on the 20-meter band (14 MHz), as this band is primarily allocated for voice and digital communication modes like SSB, CW, and digital modes. ATV requires much wider bandwidth than typically allowed on this frequency range, and would cause significant interference to other amateur radio communications."
  - text: "Slow-scan television (SSTV) on 14.23 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Slow-scan television (SSTV) is permitted on the 20-meter band. Unlike fast-scan television, SSTV uses a narrower bandwidth and is compatible with other modes of communication on this frequency range. SSTV is a popular mode for image transmission among amateur radio operators."
  - text: "Frequency modulation (FM) on 29.60 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "FM is allowed on the 10-meter band (29 MHz), which is a typical band for local and regional communications using FM voice modes. This frequency is within the designated amateur radio allocations for this band and does not violate any operational restrictions."
  - text: "Single sideband (SSB) on 3.76 MHz"
    correct: false
    explanation: "SSB is a standard and permitted mode on the 80-meter band (3.5-3.9 MHz). This frequency falls within the typical amateur radio voice communication segments and is widely used for long-distance communication using single sideband mode."

# Amateur Radio Frequency and Mode Allocations: Understanding Permitted Communications

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- How amateur radio frequency allocations are structured
- The relationship between frequency bands and permitted communication modes
- Why certain modes are restricted on specific frequencies
- The importance of bandwidth and interference considerations in amateur radio

## The Concept: Frequency Allocations and Mode Compatibility

Amateur radio frequency bands are not simply open spaces where any type of communication is allowed. Instead, they are carefully regulated zones with specific guidelines about permitted modes, bandwidths, and types of transmissions. These allocations are designed to maximize efficient spectrum use, minimize interference, and support various communication needs.

Each amateur radio band has unique characteristics that make some modes more suitable than others. Factors like propagation properties, bandwidth requirements, and potential for interference play crucial roles in determining which modes can be used on specific frequencies.

### Bandwidth and Interference Considerations

Different communication modes require different amounts of spectrum space. A narrow-band mode like CW (continuous wave) or digital communications uses much less bandwidth than wide-band modes like fast-scan television. When a mode requires more bandwidth than the band allocation permits, it can cause harmful interference to other communications.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Appropriate Mode and Frequency Combinations:
- **SSB on 20-meter band**: Standard voice communication mode, compatible with band characteristics
- **SSTV on 14 MHz**: Narrow-bandwidth image transmission mode
- **FM on 10-meter band**: Local and regional voice communications
- **Digital modes on various HF bands**: Efficient, narrow-bandwidth communications

### ❌ Problematic Mode and Frequency Combinations:
- **Fast-scan TV on 20-meter band**: Too wide bandwidth, potential for significant interference
- **High-power AM on narrow bands**: Excessive bandwidth and inefficient spectrum use
- **Wideband digital modes on traditionally narrow bands**: Could disrupt existing communications

## Practical Applications

### For Band Planning:
1. **Understand Bandwidth Requirements**: Know how much spectrum your chosen mode will occupy
2. **Check Band-Specific Regulations**: Consult current band plans and ISED guidelines
3. **Consider Potential Interference**: Always choose modes that minimize disruption to other users

### For Equipment Selection:
1. **Mode Flexibility**: Choose radios and accessories that can adapt to different band requirements
2. **Filter and Bandwidth Management**: Use appropriate filters to control signal spread
3. **Power and Mode Matching**: Ensure your transmission power is appropriate for the mode and band
