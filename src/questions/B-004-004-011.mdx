question: "In a field-effect transistor, which two electrodes are connected to the ends of the channel?"
answers:
  - text: "Source and drain"
    correct: true
    explanation: "In a field-effect transistor (FET), the source and drain are the two electrodes that form the conductive channel through which current flows. The source is the electrode where charge carriers originate, and the drain is the electrode where these carriers terminate. The gate electrode controls the conductivity of this channel by modifying the electric field, but is not directly part of the current-carrying path."
  - text: "Source and gate"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The source and gate are not the current-carrying electrodes in an FET. The gate is a control electrode that modifies the channel's conductivity by creating an electric field, but it does not directly conduct current. The source and drain are the actual current-carrying electrodes at the ends of the semiconductor channel."
  - text: "Gate and drain"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The gate and drain are not directly connected in the FET's current path. The gate is a control electrode that influences the channel's conductivity, while the drain is one of the current-carrying electrodes. These two electrodes do not form the ends of the conductive channel."
  - text: "Source and base"
    correct: false
    explanation: "'Base' is a term used in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), not field-effect transistors. In a FET, the electrodes are source, drain, and gate. The base is specific to BJT transistor architecture and is not a component of field-effect transistors."

# Field-Effect Transistors: Understanding the Fundamental Structure

## Learning Objectives

- The difference between FET and bipolar junction transistor architectures

## The Concept: Field-Effect Transistor Architecture

A field-effect transistor (FET) is a three-terminal semiconductor device that uses an electric field to control the flow of electrical current. Unlike bipolar junction transistors that use current to control current, FETs modulate current flow by changing the width of a conductive channel using an electric field applied to the gate electrode.

The channel in a FET is a semiconductor region that connects two terminals: the source and the drain. These two electrodes are the endpoints of the current path, with the source being where charge carriers originate and the drain being where they terminate. The gate electrode, positioned adjacent to the channel, controls the channel's conductivity by creating an electric field that modifies the semiconductor's electron or hole concentration.

### Types of Field-Effect Transistors

There are two primary types of FETs:
1. **N-Channel FETs**: Primarily conduct electrons
2. **P-Channel FETs**: Primarily conduct electron holes

The fundamental principle remains the same: the gate electrode creates an electric field that either enhances or restricts current flow between the source and drain.

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Correct FET Channel Configurations:
- **Enhancement Mode N-Channel**: Source and drain connected, gate controls channel conductivity
- **Depletion Mode P-Channel**: Channel initially conductive, gate reduces current flow
- **MOSFET Transistors**: Common in digital and analog electronic circuits

### ❌ Incorrect FET Conceptualizations:
- **Treating Gate as Current Path**: The gate controls, but does not conduct current
- **Confusing BJT and FET Structures**: Different transistor types have distinct electrode arrangements
- **Assuming Constant Channel Conductivity**: The gate dynamically modifies channel properties

## Practical Applications

### For Electronic Circuit Design:
1. **Amplifier Circuits**: FETs used for low-noise signal amplification
2. **Switching Applications**: Rapid on/off control with minimal power consumption
3. **Voltage-Controlled Resistors**: Gate voltage dynamically changes channel resistance

### For Amateur Radio Equipment:
1. **RF Amplification**: FETs provide linear amplification with low distortion
2. **Receiver Front-End Circuits**: Low-noise characteristics make FETs ideal for sensitive receivers
3. **Transceiver Signal Conditioning**: Precise gain control through gate voltage

### Memory Aid:
"**SD** Starts the Delivery" - Source and Drain form the current path in a Field-Effect Transistor.
